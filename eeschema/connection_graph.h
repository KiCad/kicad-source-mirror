 * A subgraph is a set of items that are electrically connected on a single sheet.
 *
 * For example, a label connected to a wire and so on.
 * A net is composed of one or more subgraphs.
 *
 * A set of items that appears to be physically connected may actually be more

 *
 * For example, multiple bus wires can come together at a junction but have
 * different labels on each branch.  Each label+wire branch is its own subgraph.
