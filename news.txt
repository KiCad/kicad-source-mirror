Quelques bugs supprimés.
- Ajout de la fonction AutoPAN:
lors du tracé de fils et pistes,  de placement ou déplacement de composants
il y a recadrage automatique lorsque le curseur sort du cadre de tracé.
- Ajout d'un axe auxiliaire:
Permet de définir l'origine (0,0) des coordonnées utilisées pour
générer les fichiers de perçage et d'insertion automatique des composants

EESCHEMA
Ajout d'un outil de placement des alimentations (power)
fait double emploi avec l'outil de placement des composants, mais acclélère le placement
des symboles d'alimentation en ouvrant d'office la librairie correspondante (power.lib)
Amélioration des outils de placement:
les 2 derniers composants utilisés sont mémorisés pour une reselection rapide.

mise a jour du 14 janvier 2004:
PCBNEW:
amélioration de la gestion de la grille:
le pas de grille utilisateur est maintenant réglable en X et en Y et nest pas
arrondi en unités internes (1/10000 pouce).
l'unité dans laquelle les pas sont spécifiés est sélectionnable (mm ou inch),
indépendemment de l'unité d'affichage;
De ce fait le pas peut etre exact, et quelconque, aussi bien en mm qu'en pouces.
Il n'y a plus d'erreur d'arrondi qui se cummulait comme avant.
la précision du tracé reste constante ( 1/10000 pouce ou 2,5 microns).
Ceci a été rendu nécessaire pour créer et gérer des composants au pas métrique,
de plus en plus nombreux.

mise a jour du 7 juillet 2003:

LIBRAIRIES:
ajouts divers.

EESCHEMA
les extrémités de fils et les labels "en l'air" sont maintenant visualisés par un petit carré affiché sur le point non connecté.
Cela facilite fortement la détection des fils ou labels mal ou non connectés.
Cependant une extrémité de fil peut rester non connectée, sans que cela pose problème.
C'est le cas de fils connectés par des labels.
Mais les fils chevauchant des pins sans y etre connectés sont maintenant facilement détectables.
