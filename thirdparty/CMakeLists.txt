# Note: The glew folder isn't added here because it is added inside the main CMakeLists.txt

# If this is not set, then we cannot set things like ARGPARSE_INSTALL to OFF before the
# argparse subdirectory is added.  Under the new policy, add_option will allow itself to
# be overridden by a previously-set variable like we want to do here.  Doing it this way
# instead of with cmake_policy will apply the change to the third-party CMakeLists files.
