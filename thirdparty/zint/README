BEFORE POSTING TO THE LIST
--------------------------
Please note the following points...
* Zint is primarily developed for Linux. While we have some experience of
  using Zint on Windows we may be unable to resolve problems if they are
  specific to other operating systems. We cannot provide support for using
  Zint with commercial packages such as MS Office or Crystal Reports.
* Always ensure you are using the latest version of Zint before posting bug
  reports - the bug you are reporting may have been fixed already.
* Please remember to state what operating system you are using and include
  enough information to allow us to reproduce the error - including input
  data if appropriate.
* Please DO NOT post messages asking for us to change the license
  arrangements. You will be ignored.
* Please remember that Zint is developed by volunteers. While we attempt to
  answer all messages within a week, this is highly dependant on external
  circumstances.
