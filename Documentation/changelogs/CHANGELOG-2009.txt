KiCad ChangeLog 2009
====================


2009-Dec-30 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Added option to use some usual Gerber files extension, depending on the layer
    Do not allow in plot menu to output files for non enabled layers.
++Kicad and Gerbview
    Display Gerber files that use usual files extension (in tree project or dialog files)
    (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_File)

2009-Dec-20 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Renamed dialog_layers_setup* files.
    Got rid of the header file since there was only one file including it.
    Auto-position the column titles based on flexgridsizer column widths.
    Added m_TitlePanel with contrasting background color (whose color value may not
    be ideal for all platforms).


2009-Dec-11 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Finished the Layer Setup Dialog.  I assumed that the new layer order will
    be in place soon.  It works fine now, but the layer order is probably
    misleading, since it does not reflect the current stackup but rather the
    future stackup.  I dropped support for a single layer board. The minimum
    is two copper layers.  Avoid the side you don't want anything on.

    Within a month I should have the layer visibility and selection widget
    in place.


2009-Dec-10 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++all
  * Factored out the DSNLEXER class so it can be re-used more generally.  The
    constructor takes a keyword table, so it can be used for arbitrary DSN
    syntax files of your own chosing.  Simply create an enum {} with all your
    unique tokens in it.  Then create a KEYWORD table.  See SPECCTRA_DB::keywords[].
    The reason you want an enum is to give the C++ debugger better type information
    so it can show symbolic integer symbols.
  * Factored out common richio.cpp and richio.h
    which is what DSNLEXER uses.
  * Fixed some minor issues with reading circuit descriptor from a *.dsn file.


2009-Dec-6 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew & gerbview
  * Moved ReturnLayerName() to static BOARD::GetDefaultLayerName() and migrated
    to a Specctra DSN compatible default layer naming scheme:
        Component becomes Front, Copper becomes Back.
  * set_color.h: Cmp becomes Front, Cu becomes Back.
  * D_PAD::DisplayInfo() changed to use actual copper layer names.
  * more layer setup dialog work, moved all programmatic wxControl instantiation
    into the wxFormbuilder environment, but this is fraught with danger:
    wxFlexGridSizer used the tallest control to establish the row heights, so
    be careful about changing control borders in the scroll panel. The vertical
    size can explode since just a couple of pixels times the number of rows
    is substantial.  Currently I am setting a 5 pixel border only left, top, and right
    but not bottom.
  * Set copper layer count is back in place as a hack until I can get the enabled
    layer bit map fully operational.


2009-Dec-3 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Make the source file to the specctra freerouter help panel be html, not *.h
    This makes it easier to preview the page in a browser.  Then autogenerate
    the *.h file from the html using a CMake script.

2009-Dec-2 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
Compiler warning, object name, bug, and string fixes.
* Fixed EESchema options dialog focus bug so escape key now works in GTK.
* Rename schematic objects for improved readability.
* Fixed GCC compiler warnings in plot code.
* Added paragraph in UIpolicies.txt about setting dialog box sizes.
* Lots of message box string clean up.

2009-Nov-05 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    control of masks clearance: Pad Editor Dialog rewritten to handle mask clearances
    and a locad Net clearance

2009-Nov-5 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++all
    CMakeLists.txt support for AUI.


2009-Nov-04 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Added: control of masks clearance
    - Solder mask clearance can be now defined at footprint and pad level
    - Solder paste clearance can be now defined as a global value
        and also at footprint and pad level.
        The clearance is defined by a constant value and a value proportional to the pad size.
        The final value is the sum of the 2 partial values
    Note: this is a work in progress:
        currently, the pad dialog is not finished and does not
        have an option to enter the mask values
    Planned:
        option to define a net clearance at pad level and footprint level,
        as an alternate value to the Netclasses values.
        this option could be useful to create fiducials, and for very small footprints.


2009-Nov-1 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
  * Added exporting of netclass vias to specctra_export.
  * DIALOG_DESIGN_RULES now remembers its last selected TAB and screen position and
    window size, and its grid columns are automatically expanded to fit the
    column titles.  Remembering screen position and size allows someone with
    multiple monitors to have a given window always come up on the monitor last chosen
    for it.


2009-oct-30 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
Replace library editor pin properties dialog box and minor update.
* Replaced library pin properties dialog with wxFormBuilder version.
* Remove DialogBlocks version of pin properties dialog.
* Add pin properties dialog support code to pin object.
* Create single event handler for displaying pin properties dialog.
* Remove left over DialogBlocks project file for annotate dialog.
* Fixed escape key bug in library editor new component dialog.
* Add GetUnitsLabel() to get human readable units for dialog labels.
* Translate French comments in all modified files.
* Some minor clean up of Doxygen comments.

2009-oct-30 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Rewrite the GUI relative to the tracks widths and vias diameters and drills selection
    and edition, for compatibility with new netclass approach.
    Now vias dimensions are defined by their diameter and drill values
    (This is also a simpler an better way than the old one that considers
    via diameters and drill values as independant parmeters)
    When set a via to a "custom" value, the diameter and the drill values are set.
    (of course one can use the drill defualt value of the netclass)
    So the via hole edit options (in popup menu) does not exist no more.
    The global tracks widths and vias diameters and drills changes are now
    accessible by a specific dialog frame.


2009-oct-27 UPDATE Jerry Jacobs <xor.gate.engineering@gmail.com>
================================================================================
++common
    Doxygen output directory changed to Documentation/doxygen
    Cleanup of HOTKEY IDs
    Creation and cleanup of hotkey submenu

++misc
    Moved pcbcfg.cpp to pcbnew_config.cpp
    Moved eeconfig.ccp to eeschema_config.cpp
    Fixed typos

2009-oct-23 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Rework on print function: fixed the fully broken print function in Modedit
    and better code.
    Removed the display vias option tool in Modedit and Gerbview left toolbar,
    because this option has no sense here.

2009-oct-21 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    * Work on Net Classes: tracks and vias sizes, vias drill
    come from netclass netclasses values. Global values removed.
    * Added for DRC drill vias and microvias min drill value

2009-oct-20 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
Replace component library editor draw item dialog box.
* Created new component library editor draw item dialog box with
  wxFormBuilder.
* Removed previous DialogBlocks version of the draw item dialog box.
* Removed some additional global variables used in component library
  editor.
* Add IsFillable() method to draw item base object.

wxWidgets 2.9 string fixes and other minor updates.
* Replace all known instances of (const wxChar*) casts to GetChars() for
  wxWidgets 2.9 compatibility.
* Cleaned up get component dialog so last part gets saved on wild card
  selections.
* Remove redundant schematic component drawing code.
* Added SCH_COMPONENT constructor to create new component from library
  component object.
* Add message panel helpers to WinEDA_DrawFrame and update old message
  panel access code.
* Using library viewer to add component to schematic now respects unit
  and body style selection.

2009-oct-14 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
Fix save last grid size and other minor updates.
* Create single event handler for grid size events.
* Fix all frame windows to use new grid size event handler.
* Use offset relative to ID instead of ComboBox index to save last grid size.
* Move last grid size load/save setting into WinEDA_DrawFrame.
* Add equality and assignment operators the GRID_TYPE.
* Add current grid helper methods to BASE_SCREEN.
* Add GetPins helper to LIB_COMPONENT to replace GetNextPin where applicable.
* Add AppendMsgPanel helper to WinEDA_DrawFrame.
* Improve rounding for display of coordinates when millimeter units are selected.

2009-oct-01 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
* Component library viewer restores state between uses.
* Fixed automatic zoom calculations in library viewer.
* Make library entry list dialog restore previous selection.
* Fix bounding box calculation for vertical field and text draw objects.
* Changed library draw object comparison to test for greater and less than.
* Initial preparation for merging separate library component draw item lists.


2009-sept-29 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
* Eliminate external direct manipulation of component draw item pointer.
* Add draw item remove, add, and locate methods to library component object.
* Remove redundant locate pin, field, and draw item code.
* Fix add new pin drawing bug that left initial pin draw in place.
* Improved best zoom calculations for small components.
* Library component bounding box calculation now includes fields.
* Removed unnecessary header file "libcmp.h".
* Fixed potential locate draw item bug in library editor hot key handler.

2009-sept-27 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    * make pcbnew compatible with last changes
        (Delete base screen in WinEDA_DrawFrame destructor to prevent potential memory leak.)
    * Starting complementary work on Net Classes (moving target)

2009-sept-25 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
Component library editor improvements and minor bug fixes.
* Component library objects renamed for improved readability.
* Fields now move when selected in library editor.
* Add copy constructor to all library draw and library component objects.
* Added copy constructor to EDA_BaseStruct.
* Delete base screen in WinEDA_DrawFrame destructor to prevent potential memory leak.
* Fixed memory access bug when replacing and adding a component to library.
* Moved library component block manipulation code into component object.
* Removed all of the global variables used by the library editor main window object.
* The usual code cleaning and refactoring.

2009-sept-22:
Command ID refactoring and other minor improvements.
* Split out application specific command IDs to prevent unnecessary rebuilding.
* Eliminate duplicate menu and tool bar command IDs.
* Split component library editor and viewer definitions to separate header files.

* Improved component library file load error checking.
* Minor component library editor improvements.


2009-sept-17 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Speed up ZONE_CONTAINER::Copy method
    Speed up NETINFO_ITEM* BOARD::FindNet( const wxString& aNetname ) by using afast binary search
    Switch to kbool V2.1. This version solves others problems in zones calculations.
    Adding another way to generate thermal shape; DO NOT USE: this is for kbool tests only
    (I am thinking some bugs are remaining, so i am always working on kbool tests.
    Klaas Olwerda is supporting me)


2009-sept-14 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    moved copper layers properties (layers couns anf layers names) from Design rules
    to a specific dialog.
    This must be seen as a TEMPORARY work, until a volunteer creates a better dialog box,
    because there is currently no other way to change copper layers names.

2009-Sep-10 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Finished initial NETCLASS work, along with UI.  Put NETCLASS support
    into DRC.  Fixed DRC dialog so progress during DRC is sensible and visible.
    The specctra_export probably still needs a little work regarding VIAs.
    I compiled wxformbuilder from source, so you may need to upgrade to
    load my *.fbp files.

    Jean-Pierre @   todo:    pcbnew/zones_test_and_combine_areas.cpp needs to
                             use NETCLASS and not g_DesignSettings.m_TrackClearance


2009-sept-10 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Work on undo/redo in pcbnew finished.
    Switch to kbool V2.0. This version solves some problems in zones calculations but not all.
    The Kbool's author, Klaas Holweda, is still working on these problems
    Thanks to Klaas


2009-aug-23 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Work on undo/redo in pcbnew almost finished.

2009-Aug-16 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
  * first of my work on NETCLASSes, more to come.
    wrote: BOARD* BOARD_ITEM::GetBoard(), int BOARD_CONNECTED_ITEM::GetClearance( BOARD_CONNECTED_ITEM* ),
    rewrote: classes NETCLASS, NETCLASSES, BOARD::SynchronizeNetsAndNetClasses(),
    added: NETCLASS::m_ViaDrillSize, NETCLASS::m_Description.  Removed netname from
    EQUIPOTs in *.brd file (were redundant with NETCLASSes in *.brd file).  NETCLASSes
    now follow EQUIPOTs in *.brd file.
    NETs and NETCLASSes are linked by pointer from class NET.
    BOARD::SynchronizeNetsAndNetClasses() will validate pointers, NETs and NETCLASSes.
  * Pay particular attention to the new:
    int BOARD_CONNECTED_ITEM::GetClearance( BOARD_CONNECTED_ITEM* aItem ) const
    which considers two netclasses and finds the largest distance from the two
    involved.
  * I would love to see class NETINFO_ITEM renamed to NET.


2009-Aug-6 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    MsgPanel is dynamically sized based on system gui font.  Before this fix
    the window height was hardcoded and was too small on systems with large
    fonts.  See  WinEDA_MsgPanel::GetRequiredHeight();


2009-aug-08 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Work on undo/redo in pcbnew in progress.
    SEG_ZONE is now deprecated.
    When a zone is fille by segment, the ZONE_CONTAINER handles these segments

2009-july-29 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Starting work on undo/redo in pcbnew.
    Currently, undo redo commands are only delete one item (and only for some items)


2009-july-25 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++all
    Rework on undo/redo and block functions
    Better and simpler coding of block and undo/redo functions
    The goal is to have the same functions in eeschema and pcbnew.
    and have a full undo/redo in pcbnew.

2009-july-18 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    First work about net classes. This is a work in progress and a moving target.
    Manual routing and DRC do not use yet this feature


2009-Jul-13 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    added support to specctra import for the <structure_out> descriptor.
    <route_descriptor> had confused <structure_descriptor> with the <structure_out_descriptor>
    The fix facillitates round tripping from the TOPO-R router.


2009-july-10 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Eeschema:
    Enhanced netlist creation and ERC tests for component having multiple parts per package
    Connecting power pins of all parts is no more needed.
    Usually, these components have in schematic duplicated  power pins.
    Op amps having 4 parts have also 4 duplicated  pins per power input,
    and therefore the user must place 4 power symboles per physical power pin
    Now Only one power is needed (now eeschema search for a connected pin
    between duplicated power pins)
    Note this is a work in progress because the ERC does not check if these duplicate
    are connected to the *same* net.

2009-july-06 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All:
    Use a common class for markers in pcbnew and eeschema:
    created a basic class called MARKER_BASE
    class DRC_ITEM is also common to pcbnew and eeschema
    class MARKER (in pcbnew) and class MARKER_SCH (eeschema) are derived
    from this basic class.
    The main goal is to use a common class for pcbnew and eeschema to handle
    errors and to have similar dialogs
    and have more comprehensive ERC messages errors in eeschema
    This is a work in progress



2009-july-05 UPDATE Jerry Jacobs <jerkejacobs@gmail.com
================================================================================
+ Closing bug 2802441, No single error messages any more, 2009-06-07 over2there.
 Fixed this both in eeschema and cvpcb, for now printing wxstring in a
 messagebox. Should make a nice textctrl dialog.
+ Added cvpcb directory to Doxyfile

2009-june-19 UPDATE Jerry Jacobs <jerkejacobs@gmail.com>
================================================================================
Added Hauptmech patch.
I Updated doc to match this patch.

++Pcbnew:
> * Board thickness in the 3D view can be set in *.pcb files (hand edit)
> * Hotkey files bug: incorrect file extension as default in some open/save dialogs.
> * Hotkeys made available for pcbnew [add track] and [add module] tools.
> * Drag and Move hotkeys extended to drag tracks and move nodes/vias when the [add track] tool is active.
> * Show/Hide Invisible Text button added to lefthand menu
> * Dropdown list of clearance history available next to trackwidth history.


2009-june-18 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Pcbnew:
    Added: in DRC tests: tests for vias min size and tracks min width.
    Added: Option to show the via area while creating a new track.
        Useful in compact designs to know how to place a via during track creation.

2009-june-11 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Eeschema:
    Added text justification for graphic texts in libedit
    Minor bug 2803506 fixed (error when mirroring bus entries)
    Some code cleaning.
    Better locating algo for arcs in libedit

2009-may-30 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Eeschema:
    Changes about thickness of lines in draw/plot functions.
    Now there is only one thickness parameter for plot and print.
    This is now the default thickness value,
        used for items that have a line thickness = 0,
        and NOT the minimum thickness.
    reasons:
        - Obviously, differents parameters to draw and plot are bad.
            (what you plot is NOT what you see)
        - small texts are not readable with an minimum thickness value
            that could be good for others items.


2009-may-30 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All:
    Cleaned and optimized code about new hershey fonts and bold texts handling.
    Bold texts use now the same font as normal texts.
    Only the pen size used to draw them is bigger.
    - The max pen size allowed depending on texts sizes is now tested
        when loading boards and modules, and clamped if too large.



2009-may-28 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Pcbnew:
    Finished code cleaning about ratsnets calculations and handling
    Obscure code removed ( I hope)
    Better names for some members of BOARD class.

2009-may-24 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Pcbnew:
    clean code in ratsnet calculations (work in progress)
    The old code was very difficukt to understand, and was sometime very ugly.
    Mainly, the list of nets (RATSNEST_ITEM class, formerly EQUIPOT class)
    are now handled in a std::vector, and not a linked list.
    This is better, because nets identifiers for pads and tracks are a number called netcode.
    now, this is the index of the given net in this list, and the code to find a net given by its netcode
    is very fast.


2009-may-12 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All:
    Rework on TEXTE_PCB, SCH_TEXT and EDA_TextStruct classes.
    Code seriously cleaned, obscure and duplicated code removed,
    and some oddities removed ( like different .m_Orient values in eeschema and
    pcbnew, for the same text orientation )
    Multiline texts (in comments and Pcb texts) are now supported.
    In pcbnew text justifications could work (but not yet used and tested)


2009-may-01 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    Better dialog options for zones on technical layers.
    Zones on silk screen filled with segments are now plotted
    Better support of multiline texts (work in progress)

2009-apr-25 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++ Eeschema:
    When annotating: tests and repairs bad (duplicated) time stamps.
    Can be found in old schematics or converted from others tools ...

2009-apr-24 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Pcbnew:
    Fixed: fully broken netlist import from eeschema when using time stamp.
    (normal operation worked fine)
    Added: alawys print diags in dialog window when reading a netlist

2009-apr-17 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++ALL:
    Code clarification: There were 3 functions to display info:
    - DisplayInfo (displaying a message info)
    - class members DisplayInfo and Display_Infos doing the same thing
      (and sometimes these 2 functions were existing in some classes)
    This was *very* confusing and created minor bugs
     (info in eeschema was not always displayed, because the "bad" function was used)
    Now DisplayInfo is renamed DisplayInfoMessage
    Ann class member DisplayInfo is used in all classes ( replaces all Display_Infos instances)

2009-apr-12 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++eeschema:
    Default libraries path are now differents for pcbnew and eeschema (as it do)
    Fixed: bad library search path for schematic component docs (docs were not found)
    Added: display actual lib paths in eeschema lib config dialog.

    These next fix give the same behavior than "old" version
    Use relative paths in libraries and doc filenames when possible
    i.e when a file is found in a sub path in a default path
    (very important for Windows/linux/mac compatibility of projects and their configs)

    TODO: allows user to add paths in list. Currently the user path for lib is broken
    (but the new code could allow the user to add more than one user path)

    TODO: do the same for pcbnew and cvpcb

2009-apr-10 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++eeschema:
    - Viewlib: listboxes for lib or component selection are now resizable
    - library cache name changed from <root_name>.cache.lib to <root_name>-cache.lib
    Needed by the new code using wxFileName.
    When wxFileName calculate the filename, it returns <root_name>,
    and the old code returns <root_name>.cache
    So to avoid problems or ugly code, the lib cache name is now <root_name>-cache
    Old cache is used if the lib cache with the new name is not found.


2009-apr-07 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    fixed: bug 2738052 (Delete tool does not delete zones outlines)
++eeschema:
    fixed: void history file list in menu
++All:
    made GetAssociatedDocument() compatible with last changes in kicad path handling.
    Get PDF doc associated with a component now works
    Some work still needed.

2009-apr-06 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++common:
    overbar patch merged in drawtxt.cpp and mainly in eechema/class_pin.cpp
    some cleanup and some compiling problems fixed.

++eeschema:
    changed dialog_eeschema_config.cpp to use wxFormBuilder to create
    the corresponding equivalent dialog in dialog_eeschema_config_fbp.cpp

2009-apr-05 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++All

    failing silently.


2009-mar-30 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    added BOM generator (in postprocess menu)


2009-mar-28 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All
    code cleanup in project_config.cpp.
    Now parameters common to all projects are saved on exit.
    (they are usally options like colors, draw options ...)

++pcbnew:
    added option to show or not netnames on pads and tracks


2009-mar-23 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    in DRC: added test pads to holes.
++Al:
    minor changes.


2009-mar-16 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    Fixed:
        bug that crashes pcbnew when removing all footprints
        (in connection calculations, pointers to pads not reset)

        bug that crashes pcbnew when filling a zone
            if a module has a trapezoidal pad
            (trapezoidal pads are not yet implemented in zone filling,
            they are now calculated as rect shape (todo: a better handling) )


2009-mar-12 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++eeschema:
    Added: option to print ALL users fields in B.O.M.,
    so if more than 8 fields, they are printed. (issue 2680640)

++pcbnew:
    Added 5 metric grids (1mm, 0.5mm 0.25mm 0.2mm and 0.1mm) in default grid list.
    Minor bug in drill map creation (PS format) fixed

2009-mar-11 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    fixed: a bug that can delete an existing zone after creating a new zone,
        if the new zone contains this existing zone
        This is a DRC error, buf can be temporary possible when creating complex zones

2009-mar-10 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
++gerbview:
    print,plot: error message displayed when no layer selected.


2009-Mar-5 UPDATE Vesa Solonen <vesa.solonen@hut.fi>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    bug fix in zones_convert_brd_items_to_polygons.cpp:
        Fixes "thermal stub bleed" in zone fill. Small (compared to thermal width) pads are handled properly now.


2009-mar-05 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    bug fix in move_or_drag_track.cpp:
        function SortTrackEndPoints() broken: does not handle pointers to pads for start and end and flags relative to these pointers
        MergeCollinearTracks( ) broken, because it merge segments having different width or without any connectivity test.
            2 collinear segments can be merged only in no other segment or vais is connected to the common point
            and if they have the same width. See cleanup.cpp for merge functions
        These functions break the connectivity calculations.
        So they are temporary disabled (see my comments in these functions)
    bug fix in Marque_Une_Piste(): the last segments created can be see as part of the flagged track:
        so delete track (or edit track width) deletes the track and some others segments (last created)
    bug fix 2660689 Unconnected pads in RC4. Also fixed some no deletion of the old track when creating a new track


2009-Feb-25 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++EESchema
  * Fixed hot key bug that caused undo and redo events in the library editor
    to be passed to the schematic frame.  Fixes bug #1896790.
  * Fixed hot key bug that allowed new wire to be placed during block move
    causing a manage cursor message box to pop up.
  * Fixed hot key bug that allows an object in block to be deleted during
    a move or drag operation.


2009-Feb-25 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
  * Markers were not shown when on top of a high-lighted pad.  Moved highlight
    drawing function into class BOARD and out of Frame.  Call BOARD::DrawHighLight() from
    within BOARD::Draw() to fix.
  * Gerbers were not generated if you had EDGE_MODULEs on a copper layer, such as in
    a MuWaveBasicShape.  The line thickness was not being put into the gerber via a DCODE.
    These gerber files were bad, and geda gerbv would also complain.
  * A few window titles were not conformant with UIpolicies.txt.
  * You could not load a *.pro file from another project into PCBNEW if your current
    project had none.  Changed wildcard mask.
  * Deleted gen_self.h and moved that code into muonde.cpp


2009-Feb-24 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
  * dialog boxes calling OnInitDialog are flashing because these functions
    change the size of controls that are already on screen.  This leads to
    an annoying resize operation.  So I renamed OnInitDialog(event) to
    void init() and call it from the constructors.  Did this for
    dialog_general_options.cpp and dialog_display_options.
  * dialog_general_options was not setting g_MagneticPadOption and g_MagneticTrackOption


2009-Feb-24 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    bug fix:
        2628615 	  Error message after right click into zone
        2625434  	  Crash after trying to edit a line/drawing
++cvpcb
    fix: 2625090  CVpcb - language selection


2009-Feb-17 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++gr_basic.cpp
    Added: Function ClipAndDrawFilledPoly()
        Used to clip a polygon and display it as Filled Polygon
        uses the Sutherland and Hodgman algo to clip the given poly against a rectangle.
        This rectangle is the drawing area
        this is useful under Linux (2009) because filled polygons are incorrectly drawn
        if they have too large coordinates (seems due to integer overflows in calculations)
        Could be removed in some years, if become unnecessary.


2009-Feb-17 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Loading a module into the module editor was changing the layer count
    of a loaded board.  This is because void WinEDA_ModuleEditFrame::Process_Special_Functions( wxCommandEvent& event )
    calls bool WinEDA_BasePcbFrame::Clear_Pcb( bool query )
    which then sets the global g_DesignSettings.m_CopperLayerCount = 2;
    This is terrible.
    We need a layer count in each board, not as a global.  For now, comment out the assignment in initpcb.cpp.


2009-Feb-17 Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    Dialog track options redesigned with wxFormBuilder
    Alt via drill renamed Specific via drill in dialog and popup menu.
    Added tips in dialog.


2009-Feb-09 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++eeschema
    Changed dialog_edit_label so that it is UIpolicies.txt compliant.  Proper case
    on window titles, resizeable dialog border, minimum text width handling.


2009-Feb-7 Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All:
    change grid size type from integer to double (using wxRealPoint insteed of wxSize)
    This is mandatory in Pcbnew to handle metric user grids without error
    (was unusable before, using integer grid size).
    A lot of footprints uses not metric grid.
    refinements for user grid (mainly in read/write config).


2009-Feb-06 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    added "cutout" from a ZONE_CONTAINER capability to the SPECCTRA export.
    added "netless zone" support to SPECCTRA export.


2009-Feb-6 Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
    Added  a forgotten contributor (Tim Hanson) to kicad contributor list.

++pcbnew:
    Zoom factors in 1.5 progression, and limited to 18 values
    (near to to Wayne Stambaugh's changes: 15 values are not enought for pcbnew)
    removed minor problems in zoom box selection (removed blank line).
    Added user grid selection in modedit and refinements when user grid is selected.


++eeschema:
    Zoom factors in 1.5 progression, and limited to 15 values according to Wayne Stambaugh's changes.

2009-Feb-05 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++All
  * Change CMakeList.txt so that all PCB object classes that do not need built
    separately for pcbnew, gerbview, and cvpcb only get built once and added
    to the common library.
  * Override all classes derived from WinEDA_BasePcbFrame so that the source
    code file basepcbframe.cpp only gets compiled once and added to the common
    library.
  * Prevent cursor movement keys from moving outside of client area by
    automatically scrolling the drawing.


2009-Feb-4 UPDATE Vesa Solonen <vesa.solonen@hut.fi>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
++eeschema:
    Zoom factors in 3th root series of 2. So two intermediates between half/double scale.

2009-Feb-04 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++All
  * Refactor header files to reduce the number of files that need recompiled
    when making changes to base classes.
  * Move sine and cosine look up tables from trigo.h to trigo.cpp to avoid
    multiple recompiles.


2009-feb-01 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All:
    change filename drawpanel_wxstruct.h to class_drawpanel.h
    and move class BASE_SCREEN description from drawpanel_wxstruct.h to a new file: class_base_screen.h
    minor enhancement for window zoom command.
    refinements in 3D zones drawing.

2009-jan-31 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All:
    Print functions and display zoom level modified to use the new zoom implementation
    Comments added in some functions.
    Code cleaning
    some bugs fixed.
    Added contributors to list in about Kicad.

2009-Jan-29 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++All
  * Replace zoom implementation with a more flexible ( and hopefully useful )
    design.
  * Removed gr_basic.h from fctsys.h so that the entire project doesn't get
    rebuilt unnecessarily.


2009-Jan-29 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++all
    common.c added EnsureTextCtrlWidth()
++eeschema
  * dialog edit component in schematic: make sure chipname text control is wide
    enough to handle unusually long chip names.
  * Retain and re-use user's desired dialog edit component window size.
    Did not have time to look at dialog edit component in library.


2009-Jan-27 UPDATE Vesa Solonen <vesa.solonen@hut.fi>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    Zone arc approximation starts with half increment offset from v/h for pads and vias
    to get more fill space between rows.

2009-Jan-17 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew:
    Found why remove unused thermal stubs fails sometimes:
    Only the first filled area in a zone was tested.
    Solved.

2009-Jan-18 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++All
  * Replace Kicad file history implementation with wxFileHistory.
  * Laid groundwork for search paths using wxPathList in EDA_Appl.
  * Made ReCreateMenuBar actually recreate the menu bar.  Now language updates
    to menus can be changed without restarting program.
  * Lots of general housekeeping, simplification, and code beautifying.
++EESchema
  * Fix zoom and pan bug in library viewer panel due to incorrect DrawPanel
    rectangle.
  * Add zoom accelerator keys to library viewer (works in GTK, not Windows).
  * Add Postscript header to new print dialog so Linux build works.
++PcbNew
  * Add Postscript header to new print dialog so Linux build works.


2009-Jan-17 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All:
    Cleaned code in print dialogs.
    They are now specific to eeschema and pcbnew.
    Gerbview uses pcbnew dialog.
    The code is now a lot more easy to understand.


2009-Jan-15 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Pcbnew:
    Added: patch from Rok Markovic (rok@kanardia.eu) to remove unused stubs in thermal pads
    Modified: print boards when printing in color mode layers on one sheet:
        now printed in OR mode like drawings on screen
        Also in SVG mode, but OR mode seems not work very well in SVG mode (tested with inkscape).



2009-Jan-11 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Pcbnew:
    Added: print SVG format.
    SVG print/plot function uses WRITE modeinsteed of OR mode as graphic mode.
    todo ? uses OR graphic mode with black background color (wait and see)
++eeschema:
    Code cleanup for Print SVG format, and used wxFormBuilder in SVG print dialog


2009-Jan-10 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Pcbnew:
    Calculations to create filled areas in a zone modified and uses 2 pass:
    1 - filled areas are calculated with pads in zone.
    2 - If thermal shapes are wanted, they are added (i.e. copper removed after ).
    Seen comments in zones_convert_brd_items_to_polygons.cpp
    The initial method was calculate filled areas in one pass.
    With the 2 pass calculation, the calculation time is more expensive but:
     - Kbool seems now works correctly in cases where the one pass way does not work
     - Thermal reliefs can have a better shape (todo..) because when calculating them, the filled
       areas are known (this was not the case in one pass way)


2009-Jan-08 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Eeschema:
    Print and plot functions now properly prints all sheets in a complex hierarchy
    plot files created have now a new filename in order to be compatible with complex hierarchies


2009-Jan-07 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Eeschema:
    Print function now properly prints all sheets in a complex hierarchy
    Note: plot functions are not updated and do not plot all sheets.


2009-Jan-07 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++all
  * Don't pan or zoom on mouse wheel events when the cursor is not in the
    drawing area.
  * Reduce all zoom code to a single zoom command handler.
  * Eliminate redundant zoom command identifiers.
  * Move pop up zoom command handler from DrawPanel to DrawFrame.
  * Change hot key zoom handlers to use command events.
  * Added DrawFrame event table to replace COMMON_EVENTS_DRAWFRAME macro.
  * Added locale path relative to binary path for development purposes.
  * Minor code clean ups and duplicate header removal in files that were
    updated.


2009-Jan-04 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++all
    wxPcbStruct.h: made m_Pcb private, added GetBoard().   Am considering
    putting each gerber layer into its own BOARD.


2009-Jan-02 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Eeschema:
    Code cleaning.
    LibDrawPolyline uses now std::vector<wxPoint> to handle corners.
    DrawPolylineStruct uses now std::vector<wxPoint> to handle corners.
