2011-Dec-19, UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
Pcbnew:
    Enhanced algorithms to calculate board connections:
    - A track is seen connected to a pad if the track end is inside the pad shape.
    - Pads inside pads are now seen connected, if the center of the pad is
      *inside* the other pad.
       (this is made to be sure a large copper area is shared by the 2 pads,
       and to keep algorithm fast).
    Algorithm to calculate pads connections is still very fast.
    However some other functions (drag pads, track len calculation ...)
    still need the track end exactly on the pad position.


2011-Dec-13 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++common
  * changed all the RotatePoint() functions in trigo.{h,cpp} to take a double as the
    angle, which is still in tenths of degrees for now.
  * EDA_TEXT::m_Orient is now double, still in tenths of degrees (for a short while),
    but the double means parsing files and saving them use a different format string.
++pcbnew
  * DRAWSEGMENT::GetStart() and GetEnd() do not operate for S_ARC like they used to.
    They are now simply accessors for m_Start and m_End.  Use DRAWSEGMENT::GetArcStart()
    and GetArcEnd() and GetCenter() for arcs.  specctra_export.cpp was the only
    source file dependent on the old behavior.
  * DIMENSION::m_Text is now contained, not dynamically allocated.
  * more kicad_plugin work.


2011-Dec-9 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++PCBNew
  * added BOARD::GetPad(int), made BOARD::m_NetInfo private, and contained
    within the BOARD, not dynamically allocated and owned via pointer.
  * added BOARD::GetPadCount()
  * changed NETINFO_LIST::GetCount() to GetNetCount()
  * added BOARD::GetNetCount()
  * more kicad_plugin work.

2011-Dec-5 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++PCBNew
  * Removed Pcb_Frame argument from BOARD() constructor, since it precludes
    having a BOARD being edited by more than one editor, it was a bad design.
    And this meant removing m_PcbFrame from BOARD.
  * removed BOARD::SetWindowFrame(), since BOARD::m_PcbFrame gone.
  * Removed the global BOARD_DESIGN_SETTINGS which was in class_board.cpp
  * Added BOARD_DESIGN_SETTINGS to the BOARD class, a full instance
  * A couple of dialogs now only change BOARD_DESIGN_SETTINGS when OK is pressed,
    such as dialog_mask_clearance, dialog_drc, etc.
  * Removed common/pcbcommon.cpp's int g_CurrentVersionPCB = 1 and replaced it
    with build_version.h's #define BOARD_FILE_VERSION, although there may be a
    better place for this constant.
  * Made the public functions in PARAM_CFG_ARRAY be type const.
    void SaveParam(..) const and void ReadParam(..) const
  * PARAM_CFG_BASE now has virtual destructor since we have various ways of
    destroying the derived classes and boost::ptr_vector must be told about this.
  * Pass const PARAM_CFG_ARRAY& instead of PARAM_CFG_ARRAY so that we can use
    an automatic PARAM_CFG_ARRAY which is on the stack.
  * PCB_EDIT_FRAME::GetProjectFileParameters() may no longer cache the array,
    since it has to access the current BOARD and the BOARD can change.
    Remember BOARD_DESIGN_SETTINGS are now in the BOARD.
  * Made the m_BoundingBox member private, this was a brutally hard task,
    and indicative of the lack of commitment to accessors and object oriented
    design on the part of KiCad developers.  We must do better.
    Added BOARD::GetBoundingBox, SetBoundingBox(), ComputeBoundingBox().
  * Added PCB_BASE_FRAME::GetBoardBoundingBox() which calls BOARD::ComputeBoundingBox()


2011-Dec-04, UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
Pcbnew:
    Enhanced algorithms to calculate board connections:
    Previously, a track was seen connected to a pad only if the track end is
    exactly on the pad position.
    Now a track is seen connected to a pad if the track end is inside the pad shape.
    Algorithm to calculate pads connections to track is still very fast.
    However some other functions (drag pads, track len calculation ...)
    still need the track end exactly on the pad position.

2011-Nov-27 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++PCBNew
  * Add PLUGIN and IO_MGR classes.
  * Remove one argument from BOARD constructor,
  * add BOARD::SetWindowFrame()

2011-sept-13 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
  PCBNew locate code refactoring.

  * Move various locate functions into the appropriate board item object.
  * Unified best zoom for all frames derived from PCB_BASE_FRAME.
  * Remove track.cpp as it is no longer needed.
  * Dead code removal.
  * Remove scary frame window pointer member from board item objects.
  * Add draw bounding box to gerber draw item for debugging purposes.

2012-Sept-8 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++all
  * Write an automatic bitmap generation script in cmake, PNG2cpp.cmake
  * Write an infrastructure generate *.png files from inkscape files, and do
    it maintaing the "as needed" change detection support.
  * Support an *.SVG maintainer mode, AND an *.SVG user mode.
  * Engineer a seemless switchover from old style xpm files, with minimal
    impact to system wide source code.

2011-Sept-07, UPDATE Andrey Fedorushkov <andrf@mail.ru>
================================================================================
Pcbnew:
    Add hotkey "P" - place item
    Add Roman Bashkov patch for record/play sequence hotkey macros
    Add record and play macros for sequence hotkey.
        Macros set to numeric key 0..9:
        <Ctrl>+<numkey> - start record macros
        <hotkey> <mouse move> ... <hotkey>|<mouse place>
        <Ctrl>+<numkey> - end record macros
        <numkey> - play macros
    Add menu save/read macros to/from xml-file
    Add configure rotate angle for rotate module: 45 or 90 deg.
    Fix segfault when move/drag segment if disconnected to pad

2011-Sept-01, UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
    Add Fabrizio Tappero <fabrizio-dot-tappero[at]gmail-dot-com> in contributors list.
Eeschema:
    Graphic texts ans labels: fix fully broken undo/redo code relative to the way undo/redo command
    handles changes (maintly move) for labels
    Fix minor bug for undo command relative to block rotate
    Remove dead code.
    Add new class BITMAP_BASE, and (for Eeschema) SCH_BITMAP to handle bitmap images in schematic.
    Remember plot Bitmaps in not possble with all plotters.


2011-Aug-19, UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
Pcbnew:
    Add support for not plated through holes (NPTH) pads
    * These NPTH pads are used for mechanical purpose only, and cannot be connected to a net.
    * When these pads have a same size and shape for the hole and the pad, the pad is not plotted
    in GERBER files.

2011-Apr-12, UPDATE Jerry Jacobs <xor.gate.engineering@gmail.com>
================================================================================
Minor UI changes that affect OS X platform.
 - Fix for opening the help contents
 - Fix for opening files with the default editor
 - Fix for opening PDF files

Solved all with the BSD open command, for other OS'es which have X11 and
utilities they can use the xdg-open command which I added to the pdf viewer tries
list.

Kicad projectview:
Remove not-existing files when a empty project is created, this confuses when
users try to open it. Show a entry that the project is empty instead of these
void files.

2011-Apr-6, UPDATE Jerry Jacobs <xor.gate.engineering@gmail.com>
================================================================================
Cleanup of all the menubar code to have the same style, remove the C comments.
Make the wxMenu behave native on OSX for KiCad, CvPCB and Gerbview and remove
unneeded ifdefs when using the wxIDs. Add a OnQuit for the gerber frame.
Change item->SetBitmap( item ) to use macro SET_BITMAP for menu items.

2011-Apr-4, UPDATE Jerry Jacobs <xor.gate.engineering@gmail.com>
================================================================================
More native OSX changes, this removes some WXMAC defines replaced by wxID
macros. These are handled by wxWidgets itself and reduces in-app platform
defines. More work needs to be done for CvPCB and Gerbview.

All:
     Hotkey names in menu's all have tabs, this looks more uniform and pretty.

EESschema & PCBNew:
     Fix about and preferences wxMenu to be more native (remove unneeded WXMAC )
     Disable all icons in wxMenu on OSX with macro SETBITMAPS

jp charras:
    SETBITMAPS is incorrectly used here. change to SET_BITMAP

2011-Mar-25 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
  EESchema multiple item hit testing and other minor improvements.

  * Add item clarification context menu to EESchema when multiple unresolved
    items are found at the current cross hair position.
  * Add collector class EE_COLLECTOR for supporting multiple item hit testing.
  * Removed bit wise masked filtering from schematic item hit testing.
  * Removed all old hit testing functions and methods scattered about the
    EESchema source code.
  * Move terminal point test function into SCH_SCREEN object.
  * Fixed bug in terminal point test when terminating a bus to a label.
  * Define the < operator for sorting schematic items.
  * Add area calculation method to EDA_Rect item.
  * Add method for returning an item's bitmap for menu display purposes.
  * Add method for returning an item's menu text for menu display purposes.
  * Changed EDA_ITEMS container from boost::ptr_vector to std::vector.
  * Factor coordinate string conversion code from EDA_DRAW_FRAME to function CoordinateToString().

2011-Mar-16, UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
Gerbview:
    Added: read Excellon files created by Pcbnew.
    The full Excellon command set is not supported, but drill files created by Pcbnew are supported.

2011-Feb-05, UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@gipsa-lab.inpg.fr>
================================================================================
CvPcb:
    Code cleanup. Rename WinEDA_CvpcbFrame to CVPCB_MAINFRAME,
        according to coding style policy.
    Change in CvPcb:
        CvPcb does not use now .dcm files, only .mod files,
        to read modules keywords and doc


2011-Feb-2 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++common:
  * macros.h now has TO_UTF8() and FROM_UTF8() which are working converters
    to and from UTF-8 encoding for any wxWidgets build mode.  We can switch to
    them at any time.  I am using them now for specctra conversions and
    elsewhere where I wanted gauranteed UTF8 encoding.
  * added OUTPUTFORMATTER::Quoted( const wxString& ) to simplify converting
    to UTF8 encoded s-expression atoms.  The recommended technique is now simply:
        out->Quoted( wxString ).c_str()

2011-Jan-30 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++all:
  * DSNLEXER::NextTok() now uses two separate modes to parse quoted strings.
    This gives us the freedom to control our own destiny separate from the
    constraints put on us by the Specctra DSN spec.
  * Added Documentation/s-expressions.txt to explain all this.
  * Enhanced our quoting protocol by moving away from doubling up double quotes
    to a C like escape mechanism.
  * Now support multi-line strings, which when properly escaped, can still be
    read in as a token originating on a single line.

2011-Jan-21 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
  EESchema code refactoring and coding policy naming fixes.

  * Move schematic wire and bus break code into schematic screen object.
  * Move schematic test for dangling ends into schematic screen object.
  * Remove left over debugging output in schematic screen object.
  * Remove unused file eeschema/cleanup.cpp.
  * Fix bug in schematic line object hit test algorithm.
  * Fix a string concatenation compile error added in r2752.
  * Rename class WinEDA_BasicFrame to EDA_BASE_FRAME.
  * Rename class WinEDA_DrawFrame to EDA_DRAW_FRAME.
  * Rename class WinEDA_DrawPanel to EDA_DRAW_PANEL.

2011-Jan-19 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++all:
  * TokenList2DsnLexer.cmake now supports comments, which start with a leading
    # character, and may be either on their own line or on a line after a token.
  * DSNLEXER::PopReader() now pops even the last LINE_READER* and returns it.
++pcbnew:
  * SPECCTRA_DB now inherits from new class SPECCTRA_LEXER, which led to a great
    deal of simplification and code factoring.
  * Moved specctra keywords into specctra.keywords.

2011-Jan-17 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++all:
  * TokenList2DsnLexer.cmake now wraps each token enum in its own namespace. It
    also no longer setup of the "using" directive in the header file, which was
    bad behavior.  C++ enum values will have name collisions unless the enums
    themselves are different namespaces.
++new:
  * Sweet library is now a DSO/DLL.
  * Brought in SWIG to do a wrap of the Sweet DSO/DLL for unit testing
    and scripting.  The SWIG DSO/DLLs are built separate from the Sweet DSO/DLL
    and are also optional.

2011-Jan-1 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++new:
  * Added the basic structure to the Sweet parser in sch_part.cpp.
  * Got inheritence working off of the 'extends' keyword and PART::inherit()
  * Tossed the units support out of sweet.keywords, since we agreed to go dimensionless.
++richio:
  * Added the problemInputLine support to PARSE_ERROR, so UI can show the
    offending line of bytes.  Yes bytes, not even guaranteed to be characters.
