KiCad ChangeLog 2008
====================

2008-Dec-31 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Eeschema:
    Note: this is a work in progress!
    Files modification.
    More about italic and bold fields in libraries
    Use DLIST to handle fields in lib entries
    Bugs and problems solved in fields edition (some are windows only).


2008-Dec-30 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Eeschema:
    Note: this is a work in progress!
    Change dialog to edit fields in libedit.
    Most of code created by Dick to edit fields in shematic is reused (this was the goal).
    Component dialog properties -in libedit) is not modified, and fields can be also edited with it.
    New dialog box is similar to the component dialog box used in schematic.
    But all features do not work (work in progress!)
    TODO (by me):
    use vector to handle fields in libraries, like schematic.
    Finish work, and test it.

2008-Dec-29 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++all
  * gr_basic.h DOXYGEN comments.  made a couple functions static and removed
    those from gr_basic.h since they are private to gr_basic.c.  changed the
    polygon code to use wxPoints since that is what the underlying wxWidgets
    API uses.
++gerbview
  * More work on drawing polygons, erasure of polygons completed.
  * Added full support for aperture macro 6, MOIRE.
  * Example 2 in RS274xrevd_e.pdf almost draws properly now.  Need ARC support
    in polygons, and need polygon aperture type support to complete.


2008-Dec-28 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Eeschema:
    More about italic and bold texts options in fields and graphic texts


2008-Dec-22 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++Pcbnew:
    Added dialog box to edit graphic items (graphic segments, circles, arcs)
    properties


2008-Dec-22 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All
    Cleaning code to draw/plot texts:
    Now only one function is used to draw and plot texts in pcbnew in all formats
    Italics texts are allowed in pcbnew (work in progress)

2008-Dec-14 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All
    Cleaning code to draw/plot texts (work in progress):
    Now only one function is used to draw and plot texts (not for pcbnew)
    (easier to maintain and ensure texts have the same size in ploting and drawing)
    In eeschema, italic and bold texts allowed (in pcbenew, texts thickness is already adjustable)


2008-Dec-18 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++all
  * Virtualize DrawFrame class methods required to eliminate compiling
    drawframe.cpp multiple times depending on the application being built.
  * Move zoom.cpp and drawframe.cpp to common library and update CMake files.
  * drawpanel.cpp - Extracted mouse wheel events out of mouse event handler,
    generate commands for mouse wheel events, and moved panning from DrawFrame
    class into DrawPanel class.
  * Initial ground work for new zoom implementation.


2008-Dec-15 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++gerbview
    Implemented most of the "thermal" aperture macro, at least so that it
    displays as concentric circles OK.  Still need to do the cross hairs.
    Fixed a bug loading aperture macros from disk, could crash gerbview.
    Switched TRACKs to after polygons in tracepcb.cpp, temporary solution until
    I have more time.


2008-Dec-14 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Display a short net name on vias and pads (if zoom level allows it).
    Short net names are net names without hierarchy path
    Add m_ShortNetname and change m_Netname to private in classes D_PAD and EQUIPOT


2008-Dec-08 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++all
  * Remove all instances of application pointers both global and embedded
    member variables.  Use wxGetApp() for improved readability and type
    safety.


2008-Dec-6 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew & gerbview
  * As a final migration step, made BOARD_ITEM::SetNext() and
    BOARD_ITEM::SetBack() _private_, starting at BOARD_ITEM in the class
    hierarchy so that the compiler will tell us where they are used illegally.
    Classes derived from BOARD_ITEM then also cannot expose SetNext() and
    SetPrev(), and this forces everthing related to BOARD_ITEM through DLIST for
    list manipulation.  The compiler turned up a couple I had missed, two of which
    were the back pointers of  MODULE::m_Reference->Back(), m_Value->Back(), which I
    do not think are needed since the MODULE owns these texts, not the other way around.
    This should be the final nail in the coffin for undisciplined list manipulation
    within pcbnew and gerbview.
  * Converted BOARD::Delete() into BOARD::Remove() and then added an inline for
    BOARD::Delete() which deletes what Remove() returns.
  * Removed BOARD::DeleteMARKER( int ) since BOARD::Delete() works.
  * Removed gerbview's undelete.cpp and made gerbview use pcbnew's,
    by moving the two supporting functions into the common base class
    of WinEDA_BasePcbFrame, had to add some "#if !defined(GERBVIEW)"s.


2008-Dec-5 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew & gerbview
  * Renamed Struct3D_Master to S3D_MASTER.
  * MODULE::m_3D_Drawings is now a DLIST<>
  * Removed AddToChain(), DeleteStructList() and replaced with calls to DLIST<>
    members so that list item counting stays accurate.


2008-Dec-05 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++all
  * Simplified and improved grid implementation.  User grid will no longer
    be displayed if it is the same as any of the default grid sizes.
  * Removed unused grid code in BASE_SCREEN class.
  * Source file share/drawpanel.cpp now compiled into common library.
  * Declare WinEDA_Appl so you can use wxGetApp() instead of passing app
    pointers all over the place.
  * Fixed assertion in debug build of 3D viewer.
  * Some general code beautification and redundant header file removal in files
    changed by the grid implementation.


2008-Dec-3 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
++pcbnew & gerbview
  * added g_CurrentTrackList, and made g_CurrentTrackSegment and g_FirstTrackSegment
    be #defines into this DLIST<TRACK>, see pcbnew.h.
  * Changed to DLIST<> for almost all the list heads in BOARD.
    Switched datatype of BOARD::m_Track, BOARD::m_Zone, etc to DLIST<>.
    This simplifies BOARD::~BOARD() somewhat, and adds automatic counting of list elements and encapsulation
    of all list operations into DHEAD member functions, see common/dlist.cpp.
  * Removed TRACK::Insert() since it no long fits with the new BOARD::m_Track and BOARD::m_Zone datatypes.
  * Removed the g_UnDeleteStack support from <any>::UnLink(), this may leave a deficiency, but this code needs
    to be external to UnLink() anyway.
  * Made TRACK::SetNext() and TRACK::SetBack() private so they may not be used,
    the only way to put a TRACK on a list is through DLIST<TRACK>::PushFront()
    and other member functions of DLIST<TRACK>.
  * Switched to std::vector<TRACK*> in track.cpp to hold the temporary static list.
  * Renamed some KICAD_Ts to more closely match the corresponding classname.
++gerbview
  * Switched to GR_COPY mode for drawing so we can see the erasures.  debugged
    erasures in rs274d.cpp.
  * Now using order specific TRACK loading, so erasures come after objects they
    are intended to erase.  Still need layer ordering and polygon ordering support, my todo.

    I do not like DeleteStructList() and plan to migrate away from it, DLIST<>:DeletAll()
    does something like it.


=======
2008-Dec-03 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Switch to polygons in zones (old way no more supported)
    areas can be now filled using solid polygons, or using segments to fill areas inside polygons.
    results are same, but using segments can be better (faster redraw time) for polygons having a lot
    of segments (more than 10000)

2008-Dec-02 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
++build fixes
  * Changed wxWidgets library find order so monolithic build is no longer
    required (at least on MinGW).
  * Changed CreateSVNVersionHeader.cmake to fall back to "build_version.h"
    when 'svn info' command fails.  The default macro that ships with CMake
    will not create build files when 'svn info' fails.


2008-Nov-25 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+eeschema
    edit component in schematic editor.  works pretty well, I'm done.


2008-Nov-24 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+eeschema
    edit component in schematic editor.  It is not complete but further.
    Keep your old eeschema binary, this one does not fully work yet, another day or so.
    Switched away from wxGrid to wxListCtrl, and that class is poorly documented
    so much time pioneering how to use it. Should go faster now.


2008-Nov-23 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+all
  + Made _protected_ EDA_BaseStruct's:
    EDA_BaseStruct* Pnext;              /* Linked list: Link (next struct) */
    EDA_BaseStruct* Pback;              /* Linked list: Link (previous struct) */
    EDA_BaseStruct* m_Parent;           /* Linked list: Link (parent struct) */
    EDA_BaseStruct* m_Son;              /* Linked list: Link (son struct) */
  + Split TRACK::Draw() out for SEGVIA
  + Added dlist.h & dlist.cpp for DLIST<> template.  All the _inline_ list manipulation
    code throughout the package is rediculous.  I don't mind list traversal, only
    list manipulation.  DLIST<> templates can be used to consolidate reliable
    list manipulation operations and get this code out of the mainline.
    These functions are shared/inherited for any derivation, so only one copy exists
    in the final program image.  To use, simply declare e.g. DLIST<D_PAD> or similar.
    See dlist.h, template class DLIST for function comments.
  + added EDA_BaseStruct::m_List to assist in debugging list manipulation functions.
+eeschema
    Started on the edit component in schematic editor.  It is not complete and
    breaks the usefulness of the editor at this moment.  Do not build this version
    if you want to fully use eeschema.


2008-Nov-22 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Some cleanup in dialog pad edition.
    Added:
    Zones now have a min thickness filled area parameter
    that ensure a minimun width for filled copper areas
    (areas below this min thickness are removed)
    Shapes also are better


2008-Nov-19 UPDATE Jerry Jacobs <jerkejacobs@gmail.com>
================================================================================
++kicad-library
    Moved {number}DIP packages to DIP-{number}__{WIDTH} seperated library dip_sockets.mod
    Created DIP Packages board
++kicad.pro template
    Added dip_sockets library to pcbnew libraries in template file


2008-Nov-18 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    First version of pcbnew using polygonal filled areas in zones in rats nets calculations.
    Needs more tests.


2008-Nov-14 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
kbool:
    Using the last version (1.9) of kbool, downloaded from the wxArt2D project site
    (see www.wxart2d.org)
    But the version 1.8 bug still is here.
    So using the workaround remains mandatory.
    (this is not a problem because thermal shapes are better...)



2008-Nov-14 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+gerbiew
  + Added support for displaying most aperture macros embedded in a RS274X compatible file.
    Cleanup of rs274d.cpp and added the beginning of the isDark support, which we
    need to discuss. GERBER::m_ImageNegative can toggle during the course of reading
    a rs274x file and sometimes this means erasing things.
  + Tested pcbnew's gerber plotting, still working.  Done
    with aperture macros for now, but we need to handle the isDark support to
    top it off after discussion.


2008-Nov-8 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++pcbnew
    Thermal shapes modification for round and oblong pads.
    This is a workaround for a bug (i believe) of kbool.
    New thermal shapes have NO angle < 90 degrees between 2 adjacent segments.
    For shapes that have angle < 90 degrees between 2 adjacent segments,
    under certains circumstances kbool drops some holes and creates a bad filled area.
    (see zones_convert_brd_items_to_polygons.cpp)


2008-Nov-8 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+gerview
    Added support for reading in aperture macros embedded in a RS274X compatible file.
    Cannot display them yet.
    General cleanup of gerbview.  GERBER_Descr replaced with class GERBER.
    ReturnToolDescr() replaced with GERBER::GetDCODE().
    D_CODEs are created lazily now.  pcbnew's gerber plotting needs testing, might
    have broke something there, accidentally.


2008-nov-5 UPDATE Andrey Fedorushkov <andrf@mail.ru>
================================================================================
+all:
   Add cyrillic font support.
   Add russian GOST worksheet support.

2008-nov-2 CLEANUP Jerry Jacobs <jerkejacobs@gmail.com>
================================================================================
++kicad:
   Cleanup comment/codestyle to make things more clear for newbie codeviewer
   and developers.
    + buildmnu.cpp
    + commandframe.cpp
    + kicad.cpp
    + treeprj_frame.cpp


2008-oct-30 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
++All
    Use double instead float when possible, ande code cleaning.
    Some changes for a better code compatibility with others compliers (MSVC)
    (__MSVC__ must be defined when using MSVC)
    (double round(double) and typeof unkown in MSVC)
    Note: I cannot test kicad under MSVC.


2008-Oct-19 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+eeschema
    Fixed SCH_COMPONENT() copy constructor with Jean-Pierre's bug catch.
    Developed a non-functional fbp file using wxFormBuilder for the new
    dialog_edit_component_in_schematic dialog which I plan on coding in the
    next couple of weeks as time permits.

2008-oct-17 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Solved a bug when creating a new zone outline that could crash pcbnew
    More about copper zones filled without grid (by polygons)
    Currently for tests only (work in progress).
    now working: Thermal reliefs parameters can be set.

2008-oct-11 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    More about copper zones filled without grid (by polygons)
    Currently for tests only (work in progress).
    now working
        thermal reliefs.
        texts on copper zones.
        Removing insulated copper islands.
    currently : not implemented:
        trapezoidal pads

2008-oct-07 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    More about copper zones filled without grid (by polygons)
    Currently for eyes and tests only (work in progress).
    now working
        thermal reliefs.
        texts on copper zones.
    To select this feature choose No Grid in zone grid filling.
    Work in progress:
    currently : not implemented:
        Removing insulated copper islands.
        trapezoidal pads


2008-Oct-6 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+eeschema
    First work on arbitrary number of user fields, i.e. name/value pairs,
    per schematic component.  Use std::vector to hold fields, added GetField()
    function to SCH_COMPONENT.


2008-oct-02 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    First tests about copper zones filled without grid (by polygons)
    Currently for eyes and tests only.
    To select this feature choose No Grid in zone grid filling.
    Work in progress:
    currently : not implemented:
        thermal reliefs (pads are always covered by copper zones).
        texts on copper zones.
        Removing insulated copper islands.

2008-Oct-1 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
    gen_modules_placefile.cpp: backed out of the "Cu & Cmp" centric terminology
    and moved towards using layer names which are BOARD specific.


2008-Sep-26 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    more about use polygons in zone fill algos on technicals layers:
    plot Ok. holes are handled

2008-Sep-26 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Starting work to use polygons in zone fill algos.
    Currently, use this to add zone on non copper layers (technical layers)
    Only for eyes.
    Plot outputs do not handle this.
    Problems with holes in zones.
    Also: first used of wxFormBuilder


2008-Sep-17 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Fixed a bug in modedit which crashes pcbnew when closing the properties module dialog
    Both in trunk and tagged versions


2008-Sep-17 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+eeschema:
    code cleaning
    PartTextStruct class name changed to a name : SCH_CMP_FIELD

2008-Sep-14 UPDATE Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Fixed a problem in zone filling algo: due tu differents ways to truncate coordinates
    between 2 functions (one round coordinates, and others truncate coordinates),
    some start points used to fill zones can be inside the zone outlines,
    but placed outside when init matrix parameters when rounding them instead of truncate.
    So zone was filled inside and outside when happens.


2008-Sep-9 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+eeschema
    Fixed a bug plotting pins with circles in them from eeschema.
    Added type FILL_T.


2008-Aug-26 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+all:
    subtle bug solved: no response to the first left click command after opening a dialog box
    (after an item edition, for instance)

2008-Aug-22 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+eeschema:
    bug solved: netlist calculations could crash eeschema under very rare circumstances.
    recent bug solved: background filled shapes (filled but not solid: texts are readables inside shapes)
        were drawn (and plotted) as filled (solid) shapes

2008-Aug-18 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    bug solved: Horizontal Oblong pads holes have a bad T Code size in the drill file.


2008-Aug-15 UPDATE   Jerry Jacobs <jerkejacobs@gmail.com>
================================================================================
+About dialog
modified: (common.cpp) GetAboutBuildVersion() is a custom build version for the about dialog
          (config.h.cmake)
          (CreateSVNVersionHeader.cmake) KICAD_ABOUT_VERSION macro added

added:  (about_dialog.cpp) InitKiCadAbout() initalise the about dialog

removed: (common/infospgm.cpp) is no longer needed


2008-Aug-11 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+eeschema:
    libedit:
        solved : a bug which can crash eeschema on a double click.
        modified : pin lenght edit in pin edit dialog. The value (handle by spin control) was not editable with recent wxWidgets versions

2008-Aug-09 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    bug solved: pads holes not printed.
    enforced controls against malformed libraries

2008-Aug-06 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Removed an obsolete option in the plot menu, in gerber format.
    Cleanup code.
    Solved a minor bug: rastnest was not displayed after a move module
    and if the command was aborted

2008-Juil-31 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+eeschema:
    Added component sheet X,Y location in BOM.
    Netlist generation: now spaces in names are replaced by '_' for pcbnew (which does not accept spaces)
    Bug: print all pages did not work.
    Please note in complex hierarchy, the current "Print All" function needs to be enhanced,
    because it does not draw all sheets but only all different sheets

2008-Jule-08 UPDATE   Andrey Fedorushkov <andrf@mail.ru>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Added displayed length highlighted net to pcbnew/affiche.cpp


2008-June-22 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+all:
    Default path kicad/share added when searching kicad data (like library, internat ...)
    Kicad data Default paths are now (windows version and linux server install)
    1 - kicad/share
    2 - kicad


2008-June-15 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+eeschema:
    Bug solved: Eeschema crashed when creating a new subsheet with the same
    filename as an existing filename, if loading this existing file.


2008-June-11 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+all:
    Online doc format changed to PDF format.
    This is **very** easier to handle, because :
    - Openoffice has a very good pdf export function.
    - Only one file for application
    - Is standart (The old html format used a zipped archive, not standart)
    - the doc tree is less complex (see doc/help/fr or doc/help/en for the new tree).

    If a localized doc file is not found, the english version is automatically loaded instead.
    No need to copy the same pdf file in subdirectory.


2008-June-06 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+all:
    minor changes
    added void SetLocaleTo_C_standard(void) and void SetLocaleTo_Default(void)
    This is wrapper to the C setlocale( LC_NUMERIC, "C" )
    and setlocale( LC_NUMERIC, "" )function,
    but could make more easier an optional use of locale in kicad in floating point notations


2008-May-30 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
    removed GPC library due to its unacceptable (and stupid) license
    using the powerfull kbool library insteed (see polygon/kbool)
+all:
    minor changes


2008-May-22 UPDATE Martin Kajdas <kajdas@cox.com>
================================================================================
+all
    Moved all XPM files to <kicad>/bitmaps directory and fixed all related files
+PCBnew
    Changed File/Export shortcut from 'x' to 'e'


2008-May-21 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+eeschema:
    Solved: problem in manual part selection for multiple parts per package components


2008-May-17 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+all
    Removed bitmaps.cpp.  Made a static library target named "bitmaps" which
    gets linked into any app needing bitmaps.  Changed bitmaps.h to simply
    include an alphabetized listing of the bitmap arrays.
    We can now continue to migrate all remaining bitmaps into:
        > the <base>/bitmaps directory
        > the <base>/bitmaps/CMakeLists.txt file there
        > the include/bitmaps.h file.


2008-May-16 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+eeschema:
    Solved: bad update of toolbars (eeschema and libedit):
        undo/redo buttons were not always updated after a change.

+kicad
    the project tree now (as earlier) reads subdirs list files when starting
    kicad. This feature can be disabled (see treeprj_frame.cpp)

2008-May-15 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+eeschema:
    Solved netlist problems for multiple parts per package components
    in complex hierarchies.



2008-May-5 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+common.c
    wrote wxString& operator << ( wxString&, const wxPoint& ) by moving code
    from DRC_ITEM::ShowCoord()
+pcbnew
  * embellished DRAWSEGMENT::MenuText() and DRAWSEGMENT::Display_Infos()
  * wrote wxString BOARD_ITEM::ShowShape( Track_Shapes aShape )
  * wrote wxPoint DRAWSEGMENT::GetEnd() which calculates the end point of an arc
  * wrote DRAWSEGMENT::GetLength()
  * Added S_ARC support to the specctra_export.cpp for EDGES_PCB with DRAWSEGMENTS
    of arcs.   Arc and lines can be intermixed, its just that they must be
    contiguous.  The user can now use the improved DRAWSEGMENT::Display_Infos() to
    find any bad or non-contiguous DRAWSEGMENTS, since that function now shows
    the two endpoints of any segment.


2008-May-2 UPDATE Wayne Stambaugh <stambaughw@verizon.net>
================================================================================
+cmake
  * Use Subversion to automatically generate build date and revision level
    when building with CMake.  Header file build_version.h will still need
    manual updates when using the hand written make files.


2008-May-4 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
  * Added DRAWSEGMENT::GetStart(), GetEnd() and support S_ARC and S_SEGMENT
    with it for now.
  * Added arc support to pcb perimeter of the specctra export.


2008-May-2 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
  * Added ZONE_CONTAINER::GetBoundingBox() and used it to clean up

================================================================================
+pcbnew
  * Added WinEDA_PcbFrame::UpdateToolbarLayerInfo() by factoring it out of
    ReCreateLayerBox().
  * Changed call in void WinEDA_PcbFrame::SetToolbars() from ReCreateLayerBox()
    to UpdateToolbarLayerInfo().
  * Removed calls to SetToolbars() from:
      > share/drawpanel.cpp's void WinEDA_DrawPanel::OnMouseEvent( wxMouseEvent& event )
      > void WinEDA_BasePcbFrame::GeneralControle( wxDC* DC, wxPoint Mouse )


2008-Apr-28 UPDATE Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
  * Layer names were not being set into the htoolbar listbox properly if the
    BOARD was loaded via the command line as happens when kicad chain loads
    pcbnew. Also, layer names were not being set if a second board was loaded
    that had the same number of layers as the previous board. The solution was
    to comment out the listbox rebuild test in WinEDAChoiceBox*
    WinEDA_PcbFrame::ReCreateLayerBox( WinEDA_Toolbar* parent )
  * files.cpp:  added Clear_Pcb( false ) to LoadOnePcbFile() and call it if
    not appending.  This way a user can get into the file selection dialog and
    still abort (change his mind) without losing the current board.  Removed calls to
    Clear_Pcb() where LoadOnePcbFile() would now do that.
  * edtxtmod.cpp: fixed the drawing relics when moving and rotating module texts.

  * Spent a 1/2 day tracking down two linked list bugs in deleting a
    DRAW_HIERARCHICAL_PIN_SHEET_STRUCT_TYPE.   I cannot believe in the year
    2008 we should have to debug a linked list function.  This is stuff I expected
    to do 20 years ago, not today.  The function
    void WinEDA_SchematicFrame::DeleteSheetLabel( wxDC* DC,
              Hierarchical_PIN_Sheet_Struct* SheetLabelToDel ) never worked as
    far as I can tell.
    Should switch to boost::ptr_vector ASAP everywhere, and leave linked lists in the 1980's.
  * Hierarchical_PIN_Sheet_Struct::Hierarchical_PIN_Sheet_Struct() was not
    setting the m_Parent.


2008-Apr-21 UPDATE   Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>

  * Made a little more sense out of the GetScreen() problem by making it
    non-virtual, and having the two types of frame classes (eeschema's and pcbnew's)
    each return their respective types of screens {SCH,PCB}_SCREEN*.
  * Added GetBaseScreen() as the virtual function which always returns BASE_SCREEN*.
  * Made WinEDA_DrawFrame::GeneralControle( wxDC* DC, wxPoint Mouse ){ dummy }
  * Added WinEDA_SchematicFrame::GeneralControle( wxDC* DC, wxPoint Mouse );
  * Moved to void <class>::Place( WinEDA_SchematicFrame* frame, wxDC* DC ) from
    void <class>::Place( WinEDA_DrawFrame* frame, wxDC* DC ) so that these
    functions can use the new SCH_SCREEN* WinEDA_SchematicFrame::GetScreen()
    function (the non-virtual one that returns SCH_SCREEN* not BASE_SCREEN*).
  * Made some menus conformant to UIpolicies.txt regarding uppercase.
  * Beautified 5-10 files.

    Made the offset argument default to the new wxPoint BOARD_ITEM::ZeroOffset.
    Coded DRAWSEGMENT::Draw() from Trace_DrawSegmentPcb() and removed the latter.

    refined the dialog_freeroute_exchange
    If possible (i.e. if freeroute.jnlp is found in kicad binary directory) javaws is called insteed of the default browser)
    So @todo removed

2008-Mar-19 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+eeschema
    Renamed some classes and their corresponding KICAD_T types so they are both
    simpler, shorter and more closely match each other: the type and the classname.
    Wedged a class SCH_ITEM underneath most eeschema drawable items, and this
    class came from DrawPartStruct which was largely disfunctional.  Eeschema
    now more closely matches what we have in pcbnew with the BOARD_ITEM base class.
    The corresponding class in eeschema is now SCH_ITEM.  Put in some of Jonas'
    patch for the dragging of a block.  Needs testing, especially dragging
    text since there is no GetBoundingBox() for that yet.  As an interrim solution
    we could make SCH_ITEM::GetBoundingBox() return a HUGE rectangle so that any class
    not implementing GetBoundingBox() in eeschema will get properly re-drawn,
    in theory.

    We are currently using XORing for dragging a single object and using full
    redraws for dragging a block.  I suppose this can be an experiment for a
    week or so.  I would not expect that dragging a block of labels with no
    other object to work currently (i.e. *visually* correctly).

    "Update module in current board" and then run the DRC checker after that.
  * Changed to void CreateSortedPadListByXCoord( BOARD* aBoard, std::vector<D_PAD*>* aVector )
    So caller can safely forget to delete the array of pad pointers and the vector's

    // then by drawing the first time in xor mode so that subsequent xor
    // drawing will fully erase this first copy and then the previous copy.
  * redraw the entire screen at end of a component move.

  * Changed
    void    ConvertPcbUnitsToPixelsUnits( EDA_Rect& aRect ); to
    void    ConvertPcbUnitsToPixelsUnits( EDA_Rect* aRect );
    which I prefer because it is clearer to the human reader of the calling
    context that the passed argument is to be modified.  References as function
    arguments are fine, but if they are to be modified, passing by pointer
    gives human reader a clearer picture when looking at the calling context.
  * TRACK::GetBoundingBox() now (1) rounds up the radius, and (2) returns a bounding
    box which is [pos,dim) in nature, [inclusive, exclusive).
  * Changed from "new wxDCClip()" to use an automatic wxDCClip() variable in
    drawpanel.cpp
  * Removed a printf() from "release" build of drawpanel.cpp
  * Added WinEDA_DrawPanel::PostDirtyRect()
  * Renamed Supprime_Une_Piste() to Remove_One_Track() and it now uses
    PostDirtyRect().
  * void WinEDA_PcbFrame::Delete_net( wxDC* DC, TRACK* Track ) now redraws
    the screen after a net deletion.

    LayerNames and LAYER_T are saved in the *.brd file and may be edited
    there with a text editor until the UI is in place to edit them in PCBNEW.
    To understand the strategy, see BOARD::GetLayerName() in class_board.cpp
    and see WinEDA_BasePcbFrame::ReadSetup().  I will be adding "Board" menu
    item to Preferences, but there is more to come before the UI gets done:
    net classes.
  * Clear_Pcb() now deletes the existing BOARD() and new's a new BOARD() so that
    the default BOARD::m_Layer[] values can be set in the new BOARD's constructor.

    Changed ioascii.cpp to save and load board specific layer names, for DEBUG
    build only. I want to add class LAYER, see below. Added
    BOARD::SetLayerName(), BOARD::SetLayerType(), and BOARD::GetLayerType().
    Will add a UI for editing those soon as soon class LAYER is stable. The
    BOARD::SetLayerXXXX( int layerNdx, VALUE ) functions would simply route to
    LAYER::SetXXXX( VALUE ). Then layer specific global variables would migrate
    to the BOARD::LAYER[]s.

    Jean-Pierre please have a look at pcbstruct.h's class LAYER which is just a
    prototype for now.  EDA_BoardDesignSettings::m_LayerColor would go away,
    and then I would add LAYER[] to EDA_BoardDesignSettings or BOARD.
    Whether EDA_BoardDesignSettings or BOARD I don't have a strong preference.
    I understand this is a bunch of work, and there are tricks needed to handle
    adding and deleting the number of layers....

================================================================================
+pcbnew
    specctra export: now generate unique pin names from module padnames in the
    case where there are non-unique pad names within a module.  Tested with
    Electra demo, and *.dsn files load OK in there as well as in freerouter.
    Stopped using reserved layer name "signal" and instead output a full
    padstack consisting of all pertinent layers for via, pads, and keepouts.

+eeschema
    * commiting my changes to allow multiple instances of a given schematic file within a hierarchy:
    ** internally, m_currentScreen has been replaced with m_currentSheet,
        which is a list or 'path' of screens.  The path of screens is used to generate
        a series of timestamps, which is converted to flat component reference via a look-up
        table in the schematic files.
    ** this means that m_currentScreen is no longer used -- use GetScreen().
    ** GetScreen is virtual, as some of the dialogs keep around a WinEDA_BaseScreen pointer.
    ** all sub-sheets in a given schematic must have different names to generate a meaningful netlist.

    Russian translation update.


2008-Feb-11 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
  * Added case TYPETRACK, TYPEVIA, and TYPEMODULE support to Board::Add() so
    that we can over time hide more of the storage architecture of a BOARD and
    isolate those dependencies in fewer places.
  * Fixed some pad orientation issues in specctra_export.
  * Added VIA_MICROVIA & VIA_BLIND_BURIED support to SPECCTRA::makeVIA().
  * Commented out the specctra design import menu choice for now, don't have
    time or need for this import.
  * Specctra export adds 1/2 mil to clearance rules for freerouter so that
    the routed board clears our DRC checker OK.
  * Session import seems done now.


2008-Feb-7 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
    added "const" to SEGVIA::GetDrillValue() const;
    added GetDrillValue() to DRC instead of accessing SEGVIA::m_Drill directly.
    changed specctra_export so it aborts if all reference designators are not
    unique.  Unless they are unique we cannot import the routed session.  A
    good example is the xylinx board which now fails to export.
    first rough work on SEGVIA::makeVIA() but needs much more work.  Simple
    session files with vias at least import.  Now encode drill diameter in
    padstack name for later session import.
    updated todo.txt file.


2008-Feb-7 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
    specctra import of *.ses, did tracks and components.
    renamed copy_track.cpp to copy_track.cpp.notused
    removed copy_track.cpp from pcbnew/CMakeLists.txt
    added setlocale() around import and export for float text style.


2008-Feb-6 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
    started specctra imports of *.ses and *.dsn, by adding menus to File | Import.


2008-Feb-4 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
    specctra_export.cpp now supports blind/buried/microvias. Fixed how modules
    are displayed on back of board. Added a circle keepout for each copper-less
    through hole.


2008-Feb-3 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew
  * specctra_export.cpp was not exporting the nets correctly, now fixed.
  * Had a problem with an isolated pad modification on a single module instance
    in the context of several unmodified instances of same module, now fixed.
  * Fixed oval pads to make freerouting.net happy.
    See: http://www.freerouting.net/usren/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=317#p408
    Done with specctra export for now, will think about adding controls (by dialog)
    on the export later.
  * Beautification of a few modules.


2008-Jan-31 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    remove the old EDGEZONE class.
    A ZONE_CONTAINER class is used instead to handle the creation of a new zone outline


2008-Jan-29 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    SPECCTRA export does most items now, except existing tracks.  Soon will
    need testing.


2008-Jan-28 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    - Better criteria to find starting poind in zone filling: the filling alg. uses
    pads, vias and track ends to find where start the filling.
    - Added a tool + option in popup menu in track mode (select track width):
    when creating a track, if activated: if we starts on an existing track,
    the new track takes the width of the existing track


2008-Jan-27 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+all:
    I got a patch from Mr. Wayne Stambaugh which makes it possible to compile
    infospgm.cpp once and link the same *.o file multiple times.
    Jean-Pierre, if you not yet using CMake, you should edit your make.include
    so that infospgm.cpp is only compiled once for everything, not once per
    program.  Wayne is a competent developer who contacted me about contributing.
    I consider him a welcome addition to the developers, Dick.


2008-Jan-25 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
  * SPECCTRA export does padstacks ok, except that oval pad's arcs need to be split
    into quarter circle arcs, and no consideration is given to "layer types".
    See page bottom of page 74 of the SECCTRA Design Language Reference, May 2000.
  * HISTORY_NUMBER was spelt with a zero.
  * Width was spelt as Widht


2008-Jan-25 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    - void Change_Side_Module( MODULE* Module, wxDC* DC ) is now member of class BOARD.

    - Better support for micro vias and buried vias (drill files now are useable for board manufacturers)
    But not yet tested by a board manufacturer. Be carefull.
    Todo: tools to conversion  between via through and buried via and buried viad optimisation.
    But must works for micro vias (needed for my next board)
    (in pcbnew micro vias are blind vias between 2 adjacent layers: micro vias must be enabled
    in Dimensions/track and via menu, and placed by ctrl v.
    They are intended to connect small pitch BGA pins to the inner layer, and can be drilled by laser
    if the hole diameter is small < 0.2mm. A laser can only drill a hole between 2 adjacent layers ).

    ** Currently use buried via for tests only, not for production **.


2008-Jan-24 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
  * Export a specctra *.dsn file includes some padstacks, not ovals yet.
  * Many many refinements to specctra.cpp and specctra.h.
  * added COLLECTOR::BasePtr(), which is used in qsort.  Could have used
  * std::sort() instead.
  * Wrote D_PAD::Compare()
  * updated todo.txt


2008-Jan-24 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Bugs about fill zones removed (not all, of course).
    Fixed an old bug in block delete (could crashes pcbnew after deleting footprints).

2008-Jan-23 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
  * Export a *.dsn file includes ZONE_CONTAINERs, was actually able to load
    a board with zones into the freerouter.net package!  No components, traces yet,
    just zones and layers.  Fixed parsers and Format()ers.
  * Rewrote SPECCTRA_DB::readTIME() to dodge a missing strptime() on windows.


2008-Jan-23 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Plot option in GERBER format Plot (Exclude Edge Pcb layer) modification:
    - the default is OFF (like odl pcbnew versions)
    - this setup is now save in config (is persistant)

    In Zone creation, now delete last created corner works.

2008-Jan-22 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
  * Actually able now to export a *.dsn file, but the contents of the file
    is incomplete, not a complete input BOARD.
  * Added DRAWSEGMENT::Show() for debugging.
  * Changed specctra.h's POINT to use double for coordinates.  Changed format
    string for Format()ing a double.
  * Changed specctra_export.cpp to actually output an incomplete file.
  * Added BOARD::GetCopperLayerCount() and BOARD::GetLayerName().


2008-Jan-21 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Added specctra_export.cpp, specctra.cpp, specctra.h, dsn.cpp, and dsn.h to
    pcbnew's link requirements. Updated CMakeLists.txt to reflect this. This
    increased pcbnew's size by 175kb so far. Started the actual export (i.e.
    BOARD to DSN::PCB copying logic) which is going into specctra_export.cpp's
    void WinEDA_PcbFrame::ExportToSPECCTRA( wxCommandEvent& event ) so that the
    huge header file, specctra.h need only be included in one or two *.cpp
    files. The specctra export menu support was added to id.h, wxPcbStruct.h,
    menubarpcb.cpp, and pcbframe.cpp. After dsn export, I intend to add an
    import, and a session file feedback merge. See the revised
    how-to-build-kicad.txt for the new boost c++ libraries requirement.


2008-Jan-21 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+eeschema:
    labels and texts display changed when rotated 180 degres:
    horizontal text are now right justified insteed of 180 degree rotated, and are readable.

+pcbnew:
    bug 1874663 solved (edit a pad netname does not work very well)

2008-Jan-20 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    On line DRC when creating a zone outline.
    Needs more work to display errors DRC.


2008-Jan-18 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+all:
    filtering small mouse moves ( < 5 pixels) when clicking.
    Starting a wire or a track is now more easily because these small moves do not start a block commnad.

+pcbnew:
    rework of drill filles creation (excellon and reports)
    needed to have a clean implantation of buried vias and mainly microvia
    which involve a more complex drill files generation
    This is better to continue work on zones because :
    hight density boards = use of BGA = microvias + good zones handling
    When a board has buried or blind vias (microvia are blind vias),
    pcbnew creates a drill file per layer pair. for a 4 layer board:
    drill file for layer1 to layer 2
    drill file for layer2 to layer 3
    drill file for layer3 to layer 4


2008-Jan-18 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
    how-to-build-kicad.txt: added the Boost C++ Libraries installation info
    and requirement.


2008-Jan-16 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Move Zone outlines added
    Zone outline DRC works (needs improvements)
    some bugs solved, but polyline.cpp still needs work.

    Block commands now works with zones.
    Some code cleanning.


2008-Jan-5 UPDATE   Dick Hollenbeck <dick@softplc.com>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
  * Added pad_shapes.h and blended it into class_pad.h and PolyLine2Kicad.h.
    Renamed the pad shapes in there to avoid namespace conflicts.
    RECT became PAD_RECT, CIRCLE became PAD_CIRCLE, etc.
  * common.cpp's ReturnPcbLayerName( int layer_number, bool omitSpacePadding )
    has commented out code that I tested as part of a possible new scheme to support
    custom layer names per project.
  * More specctra dsn import export work.


2008-jan-05 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    Added: Delete cutout outline in zone popup menu
    the GUI about zones is now working.
    Some work is needed ( a zone in a zone of the same net is not merged )
    Currently No DRC for outlines


2008-jan-04 UPDATE  Jean-Pierre Charras <jean-pierre.charras@inpg.fr>
================================================================================
+pcbnew:
    More about zones:
        Outlines can be edited. Outlines are merged if needeed.
        Currently No DRC for outlines
