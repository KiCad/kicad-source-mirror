Compiling KiCad on Apple Mac OS X
=================================

Building on OS X is very similar to building on Linux. This document will provide
a complete walk-through on what to do but it will focus on OS X specific things.
See general documentation on non OS X specific KiCad build switches, etc.


Prerequisites
-------------

Tools needed for building KiCad:
* XCode Tools
* bzr       - Bazaar version control system
* CMake     - Cross-platform make

Optional tools:
* Doxygen   - Documentation system for several programming languages

Mandatory library dependencies needed to compile KiCad:
* GLEW      - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
* cairo     - 2D graphics library
* wxWidgets - Cross-Platform GUI Library
   OR
  wxPython  - A blending of the wxWidgets C++ class library with the Python
              programming language
* SWIG      - Interface compiler (only needed for scripting/wxPython builds)

Optional library dependencies, depends on used KiCad features
* OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  => Needed for github plugin

All tools (except XCode, of course) and all dependencies except wxWidgets/wxPython
can be compiled manually, but it is advised to install them using your favorite
package manager for OS X like MacPorts or Homebrew.
Depending on the package manager the development packages of the library
dependencies may have to be installed (usually something like <pkg>-dev or
<pkg>-devel).
Further, depending on the configuration of your package manager packages might
have to be compiled with special flags/variants to support the correct
architecture. E.g., some packages of MacPorts need to have the "+universal"
variant set to also include the x86_64 variant that might be chosen
automatically by KiCad build process.

IMPORTANT:
At the moment you *must not* use a wxWidgets/wxPython version installed by any
package manager.
KiCad on OS X needs overlay support and some other fixes, which are not yet
contained in mainline wxWidgets/wxPython sources and builds.
If you don't use a patched wxWidgets you will get graphical artifacts (something
like a magnifying glass effect in the upper left corner of KiCad windows) or
KiCad will just crash on start (due to duplicate libraries).

Install now the tools and library dependencies as mentioned above.


Folder Structure
----------------

This documentation will use the following folder structure as an example, but it
is not mandatory to do it like that:
KiCad/
  +-- kicad/            KiCad source folder
  +-- build/            KiCad build folder
  +-- bin/              KiCad binaries folder
  +-- wx-src/           wxWidgets/wxPython source folder
  +-- wx-build/         wxWidgets/wxPython build folder
  +-- wx-bin/           wxWidgets/wxPython binaries folder


Get KiCad sources
-----------------

Create your work root "KiCad" wherever you like and sync KiCad sources to it:
  # mkdir KiCad
  # cd KiCad
  # bzr branch lp:kicad


Compiling wxWidgets / wxPython
------------------------------

If you don't intend to build KiCad with scripting support then you only need
wxWidgets, otherwise you need wxPython (which also contains wxWidgets).

Get wxWidgets sources from
  http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
or wxPython sources from
  http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#source
and unpack it to the wx-src folder.
It is recommended to use the latest stable version. As of this writing this is
3.0.2 for wxWidgets or 3.0.1.1 for wxPython.

There is a little helper script osx_build_wx.sh in kicad/scripts that does all
the patching/configuring/compiling of wxWidgets or wxPython for you.
Go to your working root "KiCad" and for example run:
  # kicad/scripts/osx_build_wx.sh wx-src wx-bin kicad 10.7 "-j4"

First parameter is the source folder of wxWidgets/wxPython, second parameter the
target folder for compiled binaries, and third parameter is the kicad folder.
The fourth parameter is the minimum OS X version you are building for (see the
section about compiling KiCad for further notes on minimum OS X version).
The last parameter is optional and contains make options used during the build
(in this example for building with 4 jobs in parallel).
The script will automatically detect if you are compiling wxWidgets or wxPython.
NOTE: All paths are assumed to be relative to the current directory, i.e., the
working root you are in.
CAUTION: The script will erase existing wx-build and target folders (wx-bin)
without any confirmation!

If everything went fine during compilation you will now have a working
wxWidgets/wxPython installation in the wx-bin folder.
For building KiCad it is sufficient to keep the wx-bin folder.

The script doesn't have to be used, the usual "configure/make/make install" will
also work. If you do so, be sure to apply the patches needed for KiCad:
  # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.0_macosx.patch
  # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.0_macosx_bug_15908.patch
  # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.0_macosx_soname.patch
The same patches apply both for wxWidgets and for wxPython.

There is also an optional patch that enables full screen resolution on Retina displays:
  # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.2_macosx_retina_opengl.patch

Optional patch to support pinch gesture on trackpads to control zoom:
  # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.2_macosx_magnify_event.patch

The script uses the following configure command/options for wxWidgets known to
work:
  # ../wx-src/configure \
      --prefix=`pwd`/../wx-bin \
      --with-opengl \
      --enable-aui \
      --enable-utf8 \
      --enable-html \
      --enable-stl \
      --with-libjpeg=builtin \
      --with-libpng=builtin \
      --with-regex=builtin \
      --with-libtiff=builtin \
      --with-zlib=builtin \
      --with-expat=builtin \
      --without-liblzma \
      --with-macosx-version-min=<osxtarget> \
      --enable-universal-binary=i386,x86_64 \
      CC=clang \
      CXX=clang++
If you know what you are doing, you can of course use different settings.


Compiling KiCad
---------------

Change to your working root "KiCad" and create the build folder there:
  # mkdir build
  # cd build

Now, configure KiCad without scripting support:
  # cmake ../kicad \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
      -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.7 \
      -DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=../wx-bin/bin/wx-config \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING=OFF \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=OFF \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../bin \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

or, configure KiCad with scripting support:
  # cmake ../kicad \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
      -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.7 \
      -DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=../wx-bin/bin/wx-config \
      -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=`which python` \
      -DPYTHON_SITE_PACKAGE_PATH=`pwd`/../wx-bin/lib/python2.7/site-packages \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING=ON \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../bin \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
Note, that depending on your python version the "python2.7" part of the
"-DPYTHON_SITE_PACKAGE_PATH" variable might have to be adjusted to what has
been generated when compiling/installing wxPython. If you want to use a specific
python, you can also specify it via "-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE" instead of using
`which python` (this one will just detect/use you default python).

The parameter "-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.x" is mandatory, you have to
specify the (minimum) OS X version you intend to build for. It is important that
at least wxWidgets/wxPython and KiCad (and boost, if you use an external build)
are built using the same or compatible settings. If not, you might get linker
errors, because this parameter influences which standard C++ library is being
used (libstdc++ vs. libc++).
If you don't know what to use and you are only building for your machine, just
set it to your current OS X version (e.g., MacPorts always builds this way).
Binaries built with a target OS X version <10.7 are known to show strange
behavior in some situations on recent systems (maybe because libc++ is standard
on everything >= 10.7 and problems arise due to mixing libstdc++/libc++).

Now KiCad is configured using default features/build-switches.
See Documentation/compiling/build-config.txt for a list of all CMake options
available when compiling KiCad.

Build & Install:
  # make
    ... will take some time ...
  # make install

Again, if everything went fine you will now have KiCad binaries in the "bin"
folder. KiCad application can be directly run from there to test.
If everything is OK, you can create a .dmg image of your "bin" folder or just
copy/install the KiCad binaries and/or support files (like demos or
documentation) wherever you want.

If you resync to newer versions of KiCad you don't have to rebuild wxWidgets or
other dependencies.
CMake should pick up the changes automatically and build correctly. However, it
is advised that you make a clean build to be sure (just delete the build folder
and go again through the configure/build steps).
