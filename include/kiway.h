#ifndef KIWAY_H_

/**
 * The KIWAY and KIFACE classes are used to communicate between various process
 * modules, all residing within a single process. The program modules are either
 * top level like an *.exe or subsidiary like a *.dll. In much of the documentation
 * the term DSO is used to refer to the *.dll portions, that is the term used on
 * linux. But it should be taken to mean DLL on Windows.
 *
 * <p>These are a couple of reasons why this design was chosen:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>By using DSOs within a single process, it is not necessary to use IPC.
 * The DSOs can send wxEvents between themselves using wxEvtHandler interfaces in
 * a platform independent way.  There can also be function calls from one DSO to
 * another.</li>
 *
 * <li>The use of a number of separately linked DSOs closely resembles the original
 * KiCad program design, consisting of Eeschema and Pcbnew. But it also allows
 * separate compilation and linking of those two DSOs without a ton of inter-DSO
 * dependencies and common data structures. Linking smaller, purpose specific DSOs
 * is thought to be better for maintenance simplicity than a large single link
 * image. </li>
 *
 * <li>By keeping the core functionality in DSOs rather than EXE tops, it becomes
 * possible to re-use the DSOs under different program tops. For example, a DSO
 * named _pcbnew.so can be used under a C++ top or under a python top. Only one
 * CMake target must be defined to build either. Whether that is a separate build
 * or not is not the important thing. Simply having a single CMake target has
 * advantages. (Each builder person will have his/her own intentions relative to
 * use of python or not.) Once a DSO is python capable, it can be driven by any
 * number of python program tops, including demo-ing (automation) and testing
 * separately.</li>
 *
 *
 * </ol>

 * All KiCad source code is UTF8 encoded by law, so make sure your editor is set
 * as such!  As such, it is OK to use UTF8 characters:
