/*  Note about internal units and max size for boards and items

    The largest distance that we (and Kicad) can support is INT_MAX, since it represents
    distance often in a wxCoord or wxSize. As a scalar, a distance is always
    positive. Because int is 32 bits and INT_MAX is
    2147483647. The most difficult distance for a virtual (world) cartesian
    space is the hypotenuse, or diagonal measurement at a 45 degree angle. This
    puts the most stress on the distance magnitude within the bounded virtual
    space. So if we allow this distance to be our constraint of <= INT_MAX, this
    constraint then propagates to the maximum distance in X and in Y that can be
    supported on each axis. Remember that the hypotenuse of a 1x1 square is
    sqrt( 1x1 + 1x1 ) = sqrt(2) = 1.41421356.

    hypotenuse of any square = sqrt(2) * deltaX;

    Let maximum supported hypotenuse be INT_MAX, then:

    MAX_AXIS = INT_MAX / sqrt(2) = 2147483647 / 1.41421356 = 1518500251

    The next choice is what to use for internal units (IU), sometimes called
    world units.  If nanometers, then the virtual space must be limited to
    about 1.5 x 1.5 meters square.  This is 1518500251 divided by 1e9 nm/meter.

    The maximum zoom factor then depends on the client window size.  If we ask
    wx to handle something outside INT_MIN to INT_MAX, there are unreported
    problems in the non-Debug build because wxRound() goes silent.

    Pcbnew uses nanometers because we need to convert coordinates and size between
    millimeters and inches. using a iu = 1 nm avoid rounding issues

    Gerbview uses iu = 10 nm because we can have coordinates far from origin, and
    1 nm is too small to avoid int overflow.
    (Conversions between millimeters and inches are not critical)
