 * 2 points on the outline of this pad or via
 * 1 point near the pad/via position (calculated in order to have this pad/via position
 * inside the area
 * The 2 sides joining a point on the track to the corresponding point on the pad/via
 * outline can be a straight line or a curved shape (defined from a Bezier curve)
 * This curved shape is built by segments (3 to 10) from this Bezier curve
 * Because one cannot build a suitable shape for a custom pad, custom pads are ignored.
 * Size of area (height and length) are defined from the pad/via size or for pads having
 * a size X and a size Y, the smallest of X,Y size.
