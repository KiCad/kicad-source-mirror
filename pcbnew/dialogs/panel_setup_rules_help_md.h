"\n"
"Version clause must be the first clause.  It indicates the syntax version of the file so that \n"
"future rules parsers can perform automatic updates.  It should be\n"
"set to \"1\".\n"
"\n"
"Rules should be ordered by specificity.  Later rules take\n"
"precedence over earlier rules; once a matching rule is found\n"
"no further rules will be checked.\n"
"\n"
"Use Ctrl+/ to comment or uncomment line(s).\n"
"<br><br><br>\n"
"\n"
"### Expression functions\n"
"\n"
"All function parameters support simple wildcards (`*` and `?`).\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.intersectsCourtyard('<footprint_refdes>')\n"
"True if any part of `A` lies within the given footprint's principal courtyard.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.intersectsFrontCourtyard('<footprint_refdes>')\n"
"True if any part of `A` lies within the given footprint's front courtyard.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"

"True if any part of `A` lies within the given zone's outline.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.enclosedByArea('<zone_name>')\n"
"True if all of `A` lies within the given zone's outline.\n"
"\n"
"NB: this is potentially a more expensive call than `intersectsArea()`.  Use `intersectsArea()`\n"
"where possible.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.getField('<field_name>')\n"
"The value of the given field. Only footprints have fields, so a field is only returned if\n"
"`A` is a footprint.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.isPlated()\n"
"True if `A` has a hole which is plated.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.inDiffPair('<net_name>')\n"
"True if `A` has a net that is part of the specified differential pair.\n"
"`<net_name>` is the base name of the differential pair.  For example, `inDiffPair('/CLK')`\n"
"matches items in the `/CLK_P` and `/CLK_N` nets.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    AB.isCoupledDiffPair()\n"
"True if `A` and `B` are members of the same diff pair.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.memberOfGroup('<group_name>')\n"
"True if `A` is a member of the given group. The name can contain wildcards.\n"
"Includes nested membership.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.memberOfFootprint('<footprint_reference>|<footprint_id>')\n"
"True if `A` is a member of a footprint matching the given reference designator or footprint\n"
"ID.  The parameter can contain wildcards.\n"
"\n"
"NB: If matching against a footprint ID is desired, the parameter must contain a ':'.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.memberOfSheet('<sheet_path>')\n"
"True if `A` is a member of the given schematic sheet. The sheet path can contain wildcards.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"    A.existsOnLayer('<layer_name>')\n"
"True if `A` exists on the given layer.  The layer name can be\n"
"either the name assigned in Board Setup > Board Editor Layers or\n"
"the canonical name (ie: `F.Cu`).\n"
"\n"
"NB: this returns true if `A` is on the given layer, independently\n"
"of whether or not the rule is being evaluated for that layer.\n"
