This table shows the difference in electrochemical potential between various metals and alloys. Galvanic corrosion affects different metals in contact and under certain conditions.<br>
The anode of an electrochemical pair gets oxidized and eaten away, while the cathode gets dissolved metals plated onto it but stays protected.<br>
A positive number indicates that the row is anodic (-) and the column is cathodic (+), cold and warm coloring hues also indicate rows' potential.<br>
EN 50310 suggests a voltage difference below 300mV. Known practices make use of a third interface metal in between the main pair(ie the ENIG surface finish).<br>
Selected cells shown with the default system's coloring choice after a table refill.
