You can use this calculator to check if a small track can handle a large current for a short period of time.<br>
This tool allows you to design a track fuse but should be used as an estimate only.

The calculator estimates the energy required to heat the wire up<br>
to its melting point as well as the energy required for the change of phase.<br>
This energy is then compared to the one dissipated by the wire resistance.
