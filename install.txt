KiCad installation
==================

   KiCad consists of 3 packages:

kicad         - KiCad programs and core files.
kicad-doc     - Documentation and interactive help (optional package).
kicad-library - KiCad schematic, pcb & 3D-model libraries (optional package).

Installation from binary packages
=================================

   KiCad binary packages exist for Linux and Windows (XP, 2000).

   Data files (schematic, boards, libraries) are compatible with all platforms.

*.zip  - KiCad packages for Windows.
*.tbz2 - KiCad for Linux.

Installation from binary packages for Windows
=============================================

   KiCad can be installed in 'C:\kicad', 'D:\kicad', 'C:\Program files\kicad',
'D:\Program files\kicad'.

   For example, for an installation in the folder 'C:\kicad', unzip KiCad
packages:

  kicad-{version}.zip
  kicad-doc-{version}.zip
  kicad-library-{version}.zip

to the folder 'C:\kicad'.

   The main program is the project manager (kicad.exe) and from it you can run
the other programs (schematic editor - eeschema, pcb editor - pcbnew,
utilities: cvpcb and gerbview).

   You can create a shortcut to 'C:\kicad\bin\kicad.exe'.

Installation from binary packages for Linux
===========================================

   KiCad can be installed in '/usr' or '/usr/local'.

   You must have "root" access for installation.

    cd /
    tar -xjf kicad-{version}.tbz2
    tar -xjf kicad-doc-{version}.tbz2
    tar -xjf kicad-library-{version}.tbz2

   The main program is '/usr/bin/kicad'.

Windows KiCad tree:
===================

kicad/bin                      - Binaries (executable files).
kicad/doc                      - Various documentation.
kicad/doc/help                 - Interactive help.
kicad/share/demos              - Sample schematics and printed boards.
kicad/share/internat           - Interface localization files.
kicad/share/library            - Libraries for schematic.
kicad/share/modules            - Module libraries for printed boards.
kicad/share/modules/packages3d - 3D component models (.wrl and .wings format).

   Files '*.mod' are libraries, and files '*.brd' are printed boards you can
view with pcbnew.
   Files *.brd show the existing modules (and 3D shapes) in libraries. 

Linux KiCad tree:
=================

/usr/bin                            - Binaries (executable files).
/usr/share/doc/kicad/               - Various documentation.
/usr/share/doc/kicad/help           - Interactive help.
/usr/share/kicad/demos              - Sample schematics and printed boards.
/usr/share/kicad/internat           - Dictionaries for interface localization.
/usr/share/kicad/library            - Interface localization files.
/usr/share/kicad/modules            - Module libraries for printed boards.
/usr/share/kicad/modules/packages3d - 3D component models (.wrl and .wings format).

   Files '*.mod' are the libraries, and files '*.brd' are printed boards you can
view with pcbnew.
   Files *.brd show the existing modules (and 3D shapes) in libraries. 

Warning:
Do not change the KiCad tree, or the location of binary files,
else KiCad will not be able to find its required files (configuration,
libraries, etc.).


Installation from source code
=============================

   Some dependencies must be satisfied for the correct installation of KiCad:
   
wxWidgets           >= 2.6.3.3       http://www.wxwidgets.org/
CMake               >= 2.4.6         http://www.cmake.org/
Boost C++ Libraries                  http://www.boost.org/
OpenGL
  Linux:   Mesa 3D Graphics Library  http://www.mesa3d.org/
  Windows: built-in
Zlib Compression Library             http://www.zlib.net/

   In source-tree-build are mostly unwanted, so make a subdir called "build" and
change to it.

   Call cmake with the path to KiCad. E.g., when your build-folder is "build"
within source-tree, type "cmake ../".

   Now your system get checked if it is able compiling KiCad and cmake generates
the Makefiles.

   After calling cmake just type "make" and build begins.

   It is easy to build only a specific binary such as pcbnew alone:
    make pcbnew
    
   After "make" type "make install" and install begins.

   You may install to a temporary-root with
    make install DESTDIR=<temproot>

   If you want to uninstall KiCad again type "make uninstall" from within the
build directory.

Important parameters to cmake
==============================

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<buildtype>
<buildtype> may current one of "Debug" and "Release".

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>
Default to "/usr/local".

-DwxWidgets_ROOT_DIR=<wxInstallDir>
Required for Windows platform.

-DwxWidgets_USE_DEBUG=ON
Can be used only with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

-DwxWidgets_USE_STATIC=ON
For building statically linked executables. Can be used only if wxWidgets
configured and builded with "--enable-monolithic --disable-shared" parameters.

-DwxWidgets_USE_STATIC=OFF
For building dinamically linked executables. Can be used only if wxWidgets
configured and builded with "--disable-monolithic --enable-shared" parameters.

-DKICAD_MINIZIP=ON
Build the "minizip" executable. Use OFF to disable it building.

-DKICAD_PYTHON=ON
Build the KiCad with Python support.

-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=<some extra flags>
Extra flags for the c++ compiler for your system required.

-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON
When more output is wanted use this cmake parameter or call "make VERBOSE=1".

Extra cflags and linker flags
=============================

   If you require extra flags for compiler and linker you may give them via
environment variables
  "CXXFLAGS" (c++ compiler)
  "LDFLAGS"  (for linker)
  "CFLAGS"   (for c-compiler, not needed in kdesvn build)

eg., it may usefull on 64bit systems "-m64" to CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
