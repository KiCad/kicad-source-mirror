"# 1. Summary\n"
"\n"
"The Bill of Materials tool creates a BOM which lists all of the components "
"in the design.\n"
"\n"
"The tool uses an external script to generate a BOM in the desired output "
"format. Choosing a different script changes how the BOM is formatted.\n"
"\n"
"Generating a BOM is described in more detail in the Schematic Editor "
"manual.\n"
"\n"
"# 2. Usage\n"
"\n"
"Select a generator script in the **BOM generator scripts** list. Details for "
"the selected generator are shown on the right of the dialog.\n"
"\n"
"Clicking the **Generate** button creates a BOM file with the selected "
"generator.\n"
"\n"
"The default settings present several generator script options, although some "
"additional scripts are installed with KiCad and can be added to the list "
"with the **+** button.\n"
"\n"
"**Note:** On Windows, there is an additional option **Show console window**. "
"When this option is unchecked, BOM generators run in a hidden console window "
"and any output is redirected and printed in the dialog. When this option is "
"checked, BOM generators run in a visisble console window.\n"

"\n"
"Internally, KiCad creates an intermediate netlist file in XML format that "
"contains information about all of the components in the design. A BOM "
"generator script converts the intermediate netlist file to the desired "
"output format. KiCad runs the BOM generator scripts according to the command "
"line entered at the bottom of the BOM dialog.\n"
"\n"
"The command line format accepts parameters for filenames. Each formatting "
"parameter is replaced with a project-specific path or filename. The "
"supported formatting parameters are:\n"
"\n"
" * `%I`: absolute path and filename of the intermediate netlist file, which "
"is the input to the BOM generator\n"
" * `%O`: absolute path and filename of the output BOM file (without file "
"extension)\n"
" * `%B`: base filename of the output BOM file (without file extension)\n"
" * `%P`: absolute path of the project directory, without trailing slash\n"
"\n"
"**Note:** the `%O` output file parameter does not include a file extension. "
"KiCad will attempt to add an appropriate extension to the command line "
"automatically, but an extension may need to be added by hand.\n"
"\n"
"Python is the recommended tool for BOM generator scripts, but other tools "
"can also be used.\n"
"\n"
"## Example command lines for Python scripts\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"Version clause must be the first clause.  It indicates the syntax version of "
"the file so that \n"
"future rules parsers can perform automatic updates.  It should be\n"
"set to \"1\".\n"
"\n"
"Rules should be ordered by specificity.  Later rules take\n"
"precedence over earlier rules; once a matching rule is found\n"
"no further rules will be checked.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "# 2 - The intermediate Netlist File\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "BOM files (and netlist files) can be created from an *Intermediate "
#~ "netlist file* created by Eeschema.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This file uses XML syntax and is called the intermediate netlist. The "
#~ "intermediate netlist includes a large amount of data about your board and "
#~ "because of this, it can be used with post-processing to create a BOM or "
#~ "other reports.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Depending on the output (BOM or netlist), different subsets of the "
#~ "complete Intermediate Netlist file will be used in the post-processing.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "# 3 - Conversion to a new format\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "By applying a post-processing filter to the Intermediate netlist file you "
#~ "can generate foreign netlist files as well as BOM files. Because this "
#~ "conversion is a text to text transformation, this post-processing filter "
#~ "can be written using *Python*, *XSLT*, or any other tool capable of "
#~ "taking XML as input.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "XSLT itself is a XML language suitable for XML transformations. There is "
#~ "a free program called `xsltproc` that you can download and install. The "
#~ "`xsltproc` program can be used to read the Intermediate XML netlist input "
#~ "file, apply a style-sheet to transform the input, and save the results in "
#~ "an output file. Use of `xsltproc` requires a style-sheet file using XSLT "
#~ "conventions. The full conversion process is handled by Eeschema, after it "
#~ "is configured once to run `xsltproc` in a specific way.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "A Python script is somewhat more easy to create.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "## 4.1 - Plugin Configuration Parameters\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Eeschema plug-in configuration dialog requires the following "
#~ "information:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ " * The title: for instance, the name of the netlist format.\n"
#~ " * The command line to launch the converter (usually a script).\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "***Note (Windows only):***\n"
#~ "*By default, the command line runs with hidden console window and output "

#~ "\n"
#~ "1. Eeschema creates an intermediate netlist file \\*.xml, for instance "
#~ "`test.xml`.\n"
#~ "2. Eeschema runs the script from the command line to create the final "
#~ "output file.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "## 4.2 - Generate netlist files with the command line\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Assuming we are using the program `xsltproc.exe` to apply the sheet style "
#~ "to the intermediate file, `xsltproc.exe` is executed with the following "

#~ "xsltproc.exe -o <output filename> <style-sheet filename> <input XML file "

#~ "```\n"
#~ "where `myconverter.xsl` is the style-sheet that you are applying.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Do not forget the double quotes around the file names, this allows them "
#~ "to have spaces after the substitution by Eeschema.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If a Python script is used, the command line is something like (depending "
#~ "on the Python script):\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "# 2 - The intermediate Netlist File\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "BOM files (and netlist files) can be created from an *Intermediate "
#~ "netlist file* created by Eeschema.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This file uses XML syntax and is called the intermediate netlist. The "
#~ "intermediate netlist includes a large amount of data about your board and "
#~ "because of this, it can be used with post-processing to create a BOM or "
#~ "other reports.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Depending on the output (BOM or netlist), different subsets of the "
#~ "complete Intermediate Netlist file will be used in the post-processing.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "# 3 - Conversion to a new format\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "By applying a post-processing filter to the Intermediate netlist file you "
#~ "can generate foreign netlist files as well as BOM files. Because this "
#~ "conversion is a text to text transformation, this post-processing filter "
#~ "can be written using *Python*, *XSLT*, or any other tool capable of "
#~ "taking XML as input.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "XSLT itself is a XML language suitable for XML transformations. There is "
#~ "a free program called `xsltproc` that you can download and install. The "
#~ "`xsltproc` program can be used to read the Intermediate XML netlist input "
#~ "file, apply a style-sheet to transform the input, and save the results in "
#~ "an output file. Use of `xsltproc` requires a style-sheet file using XSLT "
#~ "conventions. The full conversion process is handled by Eeschema, after it "
#~ "is configured once to run `xsltproc` in a specific way.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "A Python script is somewhat more easy to create.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "# 4 - Initialization of the dialog window\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "## 4.1 - Plugin Configuration Parameters\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Eeschema plug-in configuration dialog requires the following "
#~ "information:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ " * The title: for instance, the name of the netlist format.\n"
#~ " * The command line to launch the converter (usually a script).\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "***Note (Windows only):***\n"
#~ "*By default, the command line runs with hidden console window and output "
#~ "is redirected to \"Plugin info\" field. To show the window of the running "
#~ "command, set the checkbox \"Show console window\".*\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Once you click on the generate button the following will happen:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "1. Eeschema creates an intermediate netlist file \\*.xml, for instance "
#~ "`test.xml`.\n"
#~ "2. Eeschema runs the script from the command line to create the final "
#~ "output file.\n"

#~ "## 4.2 - Generate netlist files with the command line\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Assuming we are using the program `xsltproc.exe` to apply the sheet style "
#~ "to the intermediate file, `xsltproc.exe` is executed with the following "
#~ "command.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "```\n"
#~ "xsltproc.exe -o <output filename> <style-sheet filename> <input XML file "
#~ "to convert>\n"

#~ "\"%I\"\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "```\n"
#~ "xsltproc -o \"%O\" /usr/local/kicad/bin/plugins/myconverter .xsl \"%I\"\n"
#~ "```\n"
#~ "where `myconverter.xsl` is the style-sheet that you are applying.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Do not forget the double quotes around the file names, this allows them "
#~ "to have spaces after the substitution by Eeschema.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If a Python script is used, the command line is something like (depending "
#~ "on the Python script):\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "```\n"

#~ "\"%O\"\n"
#~ "```\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The command line format accepts parameters for filenames. The supported "
#~ "formatting parameters are:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ " * `%B`: base filename of selected output file, minus path and "
#~ "extension.\n"
#~ " * `%P`: project directory, without name and without trailing '/'.\n"
#~ " * `%I`: complete filename and path of the temporary input file\n"
#~ "(the intermediate net file).\n"
#~ " * `%O`: complete filename and path (but without extension) of the user\n"
