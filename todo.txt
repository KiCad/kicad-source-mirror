Here are some source code maintenance tasks that need to be done, and maybe some
folks will see these items and volunteer to do them.


*** @todo: grep for @todo and finish off those tasks, scattered throughout the source.


*** use BOARD_ITEM::MenuIcon() in the onrightclick.cpp


*** Use DOXYGEN compatible comments on member functions.  As configured,
Doxygen gives priority to comments in header files over *.cpp files.
Review the generated docs and start to go through the source and make the
generated doxygen docs readable and clear using the JavaDoc style comments,
mostly in the header files.  The error and warning output of the doxygen
compiler can help with this too.


*** Translate comments that are in French to English so there can be a broader
understanding by new developers.


*** Add tooltip text to all non-obvious controls in every dialog window.
Need to do this using DialogBlocks.



** Switch to a free polygon library.

1) Remove the requirement to route tracks or vias for situations where a zone is.
2) Support connections from zones to vias, and zones to tracks, and zones to pads.
Review the GEDA source code and other sources to gather ideas before doing 2).

*** improved xpm handling
Move all *.xpm files into the bitmap/ directory, and add those additions to:
  > include/bitmaps.h
  > bitmaps/CMakeLists.txt as *.xpm
Should there be any remaining *.h files that do #include ...*.xpm, kill those off
and make sure that the referenced bit map's extern char* [] gets put into bitmaps.h
and that the *.cpp files which were including the killed off *.h's now include
bitmaps.h instead.

specctra:
Add net class support to pcbnew so that the export to specctra becomes richer.
A netclass should hold a list of nets, track width, track spacing,
via drill size and via copper diameter.

wxString DateAndTime()
It seems the above function should be using a more user friendly "local time",
not gmtime.

+pcbnew
    When picking new board from the menu, when an existing board is already
    in memory, the number of layers in the new board is not set to the default
    but rather to the number of layers in the previously loaded board, and with
    the default layer names, rather than the layer names of the previously
    loaded board.   I think the number of layers should be reduced to the
    default and the default layer names should be used.
