# Note: unless you are the person responsible for creating releases,
#       do *not* change these variables.  This way the KiCad project
#       can maintain control over what is an official KiCad build and
#       what is not.  Setting these variable that conflict with KiCad
#       releases is a shooting offense.
#
# This file gets included in the WriteVersionHeader.cmake file to set
# the default KiCad version when the source is provided in an archive
# file or git is not available on the build system.   When KiCad is
# cloned using git, the git version is used.  This version string should
# be set after each version tag is added to the git repo.  This will
# give developers a reasonable idea where which branch was used to build
# KiCad.
#
# Note: This version string should follow the semantic versioning system
set( KICAD_SEMANTIC_VERSION "8.0.8" )

# Default the version to the semantic version.
# This is overridden by the git repository tag though (if using git)
set( KICAD_VERSION "${KICAD_SEMANTIC_VERSION}" )
