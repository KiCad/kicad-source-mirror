/**
 * Command IDs for KiCad.
 *
 * Please add IDs that are unique to Kicad here and not in the global id.h file.
 * This will prevent the entire project from being rebuilt when adding
 * new commands to KiCad.
 *
 * However, now the Kicad manager and other sub applications are running inside
 * the same application, these IDs are kept unique inside the whole Kicad code
 * See the global id.h which reserves room for the Kicad manager IDs
 * and expand this room if needed
 *
 * We have experienced issues with duplicate menus IDs between frames
 * because wxUpdateUIEvent events are sent to parent frames, when a wxUpdateUIEvent
 * event function does not exists for some menuitems ID, and therefore
 * with duplicate menuitems IDs in different frames, the wrong menuitem can be used
 * by a function called by the wxUpdateUIEvent event loop.
 *
 * The number of items in this list should be less than ROOM_FOR_KICADMANAGER (see id.h)
